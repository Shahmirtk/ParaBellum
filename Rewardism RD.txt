<Introduction>
/As we age and become more mature, we think more in terms of what is practical or feasible, and generally, we tend to be less creative than children. The ability to think from a fresh perspective, to be creative, and to make possible what was always considered impossible is likely to catalyze evolution­--not only ours, but also of other species. By evolution I understand the advancement from a simpler state to a more complex and advanced state, in material terms like physical strength, wealth, etc., and in abstract terms like knowledge, skill, expertise, etc. 
</Introduction>

<The Perfect Economic System>
  /To better explain what a good enough standard of living is, I find it necessary to refer to your John Rawls’s conception: “justice as fairness”. The following is an explanation which is inspired by his idea of “veil of ignorance”, but not necessarily an accurate depiction of his concept of justice.
  /Imagine that you are given an opportunity to create a world where you will have to live, and the challenge is that the resources in this world will be limited and you have no idea where you will be born and who you will be, you do not even know whether you will be a human, i.e., you are behind a veil of ignorance. To best approach this challenge, assume that you will be born into the worst possible condition in this world, so that you create the world in a way that is worth living in, regardless of where you start in the world. What kind of an economic system would you want in such a world? What do you think should be a “good enough” standard of living in such a world, considering that this would be your and your loved ones’ standard of living? It is not only justice that you have to consider, you have to keep in mind the purpose of the perfect system, i.e., evolution must be facilitated too.
  /I dream of a peaceful world, where no one has to struggle for their basic needs, where evolution is facilitated and people reach their maximum possible potential in life, and where people can confidently claim that “Life is worth beginning.”
  /A world worth living in is where conscious beings actually ‘live’, rather than just survive, where taking care of relationships matters more than creating links, where making memories matters more than making money, where wisdom matters more than qualifications, where being in the present moment matters more than the result/end, where growth of others is not considered a threat but is encouraged and facilitated, where seeking truth matters more than being delusional, where planet matters more than profit, where health matters more than wealth, and where every conscious being can claim with confidence that ‘this world is worth living in’.
  /To summarize, a perfect economic system’s broad goal is to ensure everyone has at least a ‘good enough’ standard of living and any ‘meaningful work’ earns the worker a reward based on how meaningful it is. A standard would be considered ‘good enough’ if, even in the worst case, peace is maintained by fulfilling basic needs and evolution is facilitated. ‘Meaningful work’ is that which at least maintains peace, and its ‘meaningfulness’ is based on how much the quality of life enhances because of it and how much it facilitates evolution.
</The Perfect Economic System>

<Cons of Capitalism>
  /We have to think about the pros and cons of the money-based system before coming up with a better system so that the benefits can be carried forward and the problems can be dealt with. Only knowing what the pros and cons are is not going to be of much benefit to us; a good understanding of how and why these pros and cons exist is what will help us come up with a better system. 
  /I must mention that I understand that money, or the love for it, is not the root of all evil because money is simply a tool for making trade easier; I believe it is really ignorance that is the root of all evil. Obviously, the wise among you earn and utilize money without committing any evil deeds because they are not ignorant. Though still, I understand that people can do very questionable things just to acquire more money.
  /Before I begin explaining how this money-based system makes it difficult for developing and under-developed nations in becoming developed nations, I must make it clear that I understand the importance of debt for the advancement of such nations. Indeed, it is difficult to say with confidence that such nations would have been more developed if they were not given any debt at all. Obviously, the problem at core is corruption and misuse of funds. However, it is also wrong to neglect the expense of obtaining this source of capital, especially considering how risky it is to provide funds to such nations and how significantly the cost of capital increases because of this risk. Of course, we cannot expect organizations to give away their wealth without expecting a return on their investment. 
  /Take an example of a developing country, Pakistan. The total of interest expense stated on the ‘Summary of Pakistan’s External Debt Servicing’ report for the FY 19 is 2.951 billion USD. This amount is more than 34% of the principal amount stated. (Source: http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/pakdebtsvr_summary.pdf) 
understand that the loss of any human is effectively a loss of your specie as a whole. 
 /To better understand how all this cost of capital is an obstacle in the advancement of your specie, imagine for a moment, what if all the money wasted on interest was actually used for development of nations. Do you not think you humans would be much more advanced than you are now? Imagine all those countries having the funds required to better educate the public. It is very difficult to claim that such development is possible using the money-based system. This hindrance in the development of developing and under-developed nations is not just because of the cost of capital; it also has a lot to do with other problems mentioned earlier, such as corruption. 
  /Would it be too extreme to say that the debtors effectively become modern slaves? Do the creditors not really control the debtors in a way? If you understood how important the advancement of the debtors is for your evolution, you would try your best to help them get developed rather than trying to show your dominance or power. 
/Do you not find it absurd that people around the globe do not have access to proper education, food and other very basic necessities simply because they cannot afford them? Do you not understand how much this affects the advancement of you humans as a whole? You only need to sincerely put yourself in the shoes of a poor person to realise how big this problem really is. The purpose of highlighting this problem is not to make you sad, but to make you realise that this really is a weakness. 
 /'Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s*** we don't need.' Think about the significance of this quote. What problem is it highlighting? the problem that I want to highlight is deeper than consumerism. You see, this money-based system leaves rewarding to the unseen hands of supply and demand. It is possible that some work which the wise among you consider to be meaningless might be in great demand, whereas other work which they consider to be very meaningful might not be popular or even hated. ­­­You are wise enough to understand the implications, I hope.
/Do not get me wrong, I am not really focusing on meaningless work leading to improvement in the standard of living; if someone's standard of living improves without harming others, it should not be our concern. What I am trying to highlight here is that there is a lack of a proper criteria or system for rewarding meaningful work. A possible implication of this weakness is that the standard of living of those who do meaningful work might not improve at all, or even if it does improve, it might not improve to the level of those who do meaningless work. This can result in demoralization and lack of interest in working hard for advancement. I hope you humans realize how deeply troubling it is when the wise among you are neglected.

/Conclusion: Can you think of more weaknesses or problems of the money-based system? Why do you think such problems exist? Think about solutions for these problems. Use your ability to think, after all it is an amazing ability. Let your imagination run wild. While you are at it, consider the benefits of the money-based system too; think about how it contributes to increased productivity, widespread availability of high-demand products and services at relatively low price, improvement in highest standard of living; focus on how does this system have these benefits.
</Cons of Capitalism>

<Deployment>
what is the best way to establish this new system? Ideally, there should be no loss of life or resource; whoever loses control over his/her property (including any business) should be given a reasonable amount of reward points in return. Basically, justice should be a top priority. Please think about the best way yourself before reading my suggestion. That way you can compare the two and hopefully, bring further improvement.
Is it not possible that I am unaware of some flaws in my reasoning? Perhaps what I consider best for everyone or what I think is advancement of us humans might actually be the reason for our downfall and misery; is that not possible? How can I ensure my reasoning is as free of flaws as possible? The answer is 'constructive criticism' - not just finding the fallacies in others’ arguments but also appreciating criticism of my own ideas and arguments, and acknowledging the fact that there can be flaws in my reasoning too. Does it not make more sense to actually question what I consider 'best', to understand different opinions and to allow constructive criticism, before we put in the effort to bring about that change? I must not let dogma, peer pressure, traditions or any emotional factor cloud my judgement. So, the initial stage would be the understanding and criticizing of Rewardism by the well-educated, and wise ones.
  Before you make an investment, start a career, or take any important decision, what is it that you do so carefully? Assuming that you take such decisions responsibly, you first carry out an in-depth analysis of whatever data is available and evaluate it; you consider as many possibilities as you can and you weigh your options; you think about all the ways it can go wrong; in other words, you try to understand every significant thing relating to the task at hand, especially the relevant consequences, and you do this as objectively as you can. So, in the preliminary stage you have to understand everything relating to the system, how to establish it, and the different consequences of establishing it. By now, I hope you have a good understanding about the importance of establishing the reward-based decision and about the weaknesses of the money-based system.
  By having a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of both the systems, you should be able to polish the new system by dealing with its weaknesses and finding ways to maintain the benefits of the old system; however, this is easier said than done. This preliminary stage is of utmost importance because it helps ensure most of the problems are dealt with before execution of the plan, and thus, helping with a smooth launch. If this stage is executed properly, probably people will be more hopeful because they will know that the system has been analysed in a detailed manner. That is why the most competent humans are needed.
  To ensure that objectivity and the highest possible standard of work is maintained by them, they should be rewarded handsomely. It is better that they are paid in the new currency, however, whoever wants to be paid in USD should be paid in USD. Paying them in the new currency, RP (Reward Points, not Rupiah), is better because it incentivizes them to establish the new system properly. All willing developed countries should bear the cost of these teams/organizations. Those who understand the significance of their work do not think of these payments as a burden. 
  It is possible that some party or group is against adopting the new system because they consider themselves to be better off in the old one and they think that in the new system they will lose something very important to them, like 'power'. People might not really understand it, and so, they can have irrational fears. Misconception or misunderstanding about a new thing can be a threat to it.
  The documentation of the new system is very important for properly dealing with the threat of people not understanding the new system properly, and for stopping any rumours from spreading.
  So, how exactly should the document be published? There should be at least three stages of publishing the document explaining the reward-based system. The first stage should last about 5 years. At this stage, all the details of the system should be discussed and improvements should be proposed. A comprehensive document of the reward-based system must include its detailed comparison with the money-based system. This comparison must be accompanied with an objective explanation of how the weaknesses of both the money-based system and the reward-based system have been dealt with and how the benefits of the money-based system have been retained in the new system. By the end of the 5 years, the initial draft version should be approved by the overseers so that stage 2 can be started.
  The second stage should last about 1 year. Other professionals should be given access to the approved initial draft version of the document, so that they too can suggest improvements. As many suggestions as possible should be considered and the document should be updated accordingly. By the end of the year, the updated document should be approved by the overseers so that the final stage can start.
  The final stage of publishing should last about 4 years. The second version of the document should be made available publicly, so that the final opinions can be taken on the document. It is possible that there will be an overwhelming amount of opinions; to ensure that the best opinions are considered, opinions by the most educated and competent among the public should be given preference. The document should be finalized according to these opinions and be approved by the highest authority figures and published.
  This document should help clear any misconceptions and misunderstandings about the new system, which will result in better transparency between the authorities and the general public. Keep in mind that even though this would be the finalized document, this does not mean that there will be no improvement in the future. The purpose of the finalized document is to act as a guidance for establishing the system for the first time. Once the system starts running normally, it can then be improved further. Once this document is ready, the planning phase should begin.
  The document explaining Rewardism should specifically and comprehensively explain the base-standard of living, and it should distinguish between necessities and luxuries. The best plan is the most comprehensive plan which considers all possible risks, and provides practical solutions to manage them. The best planner will, therefore, be aware of almost all possible risks, and will plan accordingly
  The plan should be reflected in a comprehensive document. To ensure all the objectives are met on a timely basis, deadlines and performance-based rewards of the workers should be set at the planning stage to motivate the workers to meet the objectives on time. Before the plan can be executed, this document must be approved by the supermajority of the leaders, and by the relevant people in power of all the countries where Rewardism is to be deployed, e.g., Prime Ministers, Presidents, Kings, Queens, etc. Prioritizing transparency is likely to help develop trust in the WRMO, and therefore, in the new system.
  After the planning stage, the main responsibility of the overseers will be to ensure that everything goes according to the plan and to update the plan according to the new findings. For this purpose, the plan should explain how the process will be controlled, i.e., there should be appropriate control procedures in place. If people understand what exactly is Rewardism and if the relevant teams understand what exactly is the plan for deploying it, the execution stage should prove to be quite simple.
  The executors should not be left on their own, rather, they must provide their managers with all the necessary evidence of the work they have done, and they must update the managers about the work they intend to do. The managers should only accept the evidence if they have reasonable assurance that it is sufficient and appropriate, and they must authorize the workers only if the work to be done falls in line with the current plan. The overseers should be provided with the relevant evidence on a timely basis by the managers so that they can take the necessary action on time. If the plan is executed successfully and the overseers are convinced that the new system has been deployed properly, then there should be a final generous reward for everyone who contibuted, in proportion to their contributions.
  So, what should the document explaining the plan include? Even though this planning is a complicated task which requires the joint effort of many experienced intellectuals, I would like to contribute too. The document should clearly explain the process of hiring the executors of the plan. Specifics like education, experience, character etc. should be specified. Their salaries & rewards should be set before the hiring process, though, some flexibility should be possible during the process. The nature of job, working hours, meetings, appraisal, etc., should be explained too. Clearly explaining all these points should help ensure that the right people are hired and that they are properly informed and motivated.
  Accounts of all entities of a Rewardist country should be made. The assets of all entities should be recorded in their respective asset registers. Each assets value in RPs should simply be what its value is in the original currency, as initially, the RP of each country should be pegged to the currency of that country.
  Think about the weaknesses or risks associated with this reward-based system. What are the threats to the establishment of this system?

<Why Rewardism>
I would like you to compare the money-based system with the perfect economic system that I have hopefully created clearly in your mind. Carefully analyse how the two are different and why there are such differences.
If these needs are accounted for successfully, child mortality rate should decrease and the physical and mental health of the population should improve generally. If you are properly educated, you are more likely to advance to great heights because you are more likely to understand what great heights are and their importance and also how to get there.
I want you to imagine what such a system should be like, what must change in the present system, and what kind of world do you want to live in with your loved ones? More importantly think about ‘why’ such changes are necessary.
‘If you have your Why? of life, you can put up with just about any How?’ - Friedrich Nietzsche
If you humans understand why you want to struggle and put in the effort to achieve something, you can put up with just about any difficulty or problem, however, if no convincing cause is there, you will not find it worth achieving and thus, it will become very difficult for you to achieve it. Another factor that plays an important role in achieving just about anything is hope, because even if you know why something has to change but have no hope of achieving it, you are unlikely to put in the necessary effort; without hope you are most likely to think ‘what is the point of all my effort, people do not change, nothing will change’. Having a reason and hope to change the world to make it worth living in will help you greatly in bringing about that change.
  As this should be the base standard of living of everyone, nobody should be left out because of factors like his/her financial status, gender, ethnicity, religion etc. deal with this weakness in such a way that its benefits such as how it incentivizes productivity and innovation are retained; ‘Don’t throw the baby with the bathwater’, if you may. After all, if you get rid of money completely, how will you differ between those who do meaningful work and those who do not care?
  Such a currency is unlikely to cause people to become immoral because achieving it through a dishonest manner is going to be very difficult and not without consequences; rather, it is likely to cause people to do more meaningful work for maintaining and improving the world. I do not see how it would be easy to bribe someone or do corruption in this system, especially because these activities rely heavily on transferring and hiding money; similarly, money laundering would become impossible as it is really the act of hiding the source of money. Though I know you humans, you will still find a way; nevertheless, the wise must strive to prevent evil.
  And what better resource than an intellectual? It is also said that a very wise and famous scientist among you, Mr. Albert Einstein, considered himself as a world citizen. Here, let me help you peek into his interview, by George Sylvester Viereck, through this excerpt of The Saturday Evening Post:
  “ Do you look upon yourself as a German
or as a Jew?"
  “ It is quite possible," Einstein replied,
“to be both. I look upon myself as a man.
Nationalism is an infantile disease.   It is
the measles of mankind."
  ‘But what does globalization have to do with helping countries drowning in debt?’, you ask? Ask yourself: ‘Can your left hand owe anything to your right hand? Can your body function optimally if some part of it is denied energy or very important nutrients?’ To really understand the importance of true globalization, you must consider the whole world and all the conscious beings as a single entity; then, you should understand how the suffering of even the smallest part of it is sad and wrong; then, you should realize how much the success of others is important for your own success.
  To better understand this point, take the most developed country in the world and consider the whole world to be that one country, just with access to more resources. The reward-based system deals with the negative side of consumerism easily because ideally, only meaningful work is rewarded. Considering the preciousness of reward points and the unavailability of meaningless services & products, you humans wasting your hard-earned reward points seems unlikely to me. Furthermore, the resources managers must try their best to minimize excessive consumption, so that the maximum number of people can benefit from the limited resources.

# := Relevant to Chapter 8: Why Rewardism.

Purpose of economic system:
# The total wealth/resources of the world are finite and no man can increase that really. The task of the economist is then to utilize and spread these resources and this wealth in the best possible way.
# "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer." {on the significance of giving preference to consumers over producers}

Real wealth:
# "Labour remains the real price: money prices are just nominal prices. We buy in from others things that it would cost us more toil and trouble to do for ourselves. The real wealth that we obtain from exchanging with others is their labor, not their money." {use this quote for promoting the idea that money is not important but people and their activities so if we can promote good activities using reward-based system it would be better than people doing weird stuff to get money}  
# Money is a utensil, just like pots and pans. The fact that wealth and money are separate things can be shown quite easily. After all, a person who receives a guinea of income today may spend that same guinea tomorrow, thus providing the income of a second; and that person may spend the same guinea on the next day, providing the income of a third. So, the amount of money in circulation is clearly much less than the total income of the nation. National income is the quantity of goods bought and sold, not the metal pieces that happen to be used to facilitate the exchange of that product. {highlight significance of activity over money} 

Human nature (against cynicism):
#�How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.� - The Theory of Moral Sentiments
# "A man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants." {on the significance of doing your work yourself}
# Opposition from those in power: accounting for the self-interest of those in power will make a system more likely to be established, simply because they will support it.

Against profligacy:
# The first remedy for self-neglect and profligacy is the study of science and philosophy. The second is to amuse and divert people by promoting the arts. {on the significance of art, science and philosophy} => Explain how to deal with very high buying power and demand.

Directing:
# �The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.� {on the significance of liberty and non-interference} => Explain how it is possible to direct it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society

Erasing debt:
# So capital is being transferred from people who have a keen interest in using it productively to those, mere creditors, who have no interest in the condition of land or the good management of the capital stock at all.

# Seperation of responsibilities will allow both (government and WRMO) to focus on their specific ones and better perform. 

# <Public Officals> �The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or less the necessity of application in the teachers Their subsistence [is] altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions� {on the significance of performance-based rewards} 
# <Public Officals>  �... and it has, I am afraid, been too common for vessels to fit out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty.� <this is particularly relevant to setting the reward appropriately>
# <Employment Income> {link these points to the basis on which people should be rewarded} The non-pecuniary costs and benefits of different industries: 
  ->	Some professions may be easier, cleaner, or more respectable than others.
  ->	Some professions are difficult or expensive to learn. 
  ->	Some trades are seasonal. 
  ->	Earnings are higher in trades that require a large degree of trust (doctors, lawyers, etc.).
  ->	Earnings reflect the probability of success in any profession (rarity and beauty of talents in professions like acting, singing, etc.).
