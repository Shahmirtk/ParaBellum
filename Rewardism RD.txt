# := Relevant to Chapter 8: Why Rewardism

[
Approach:
# Keep the Explanation of Rewardism in mind when writing. Explain why you made Rewardism this way, and not some other way.
/# Write why the two classes would want Rewardism implemented, from their PoV. There being two groups of people sitting in front of you in an auditorium, the reader sitting in the group relevant to him. Start by adressing the small group of people, the “ruling class.” Explain why it is important to convince them first: mainly, because it is actually they who need convincing, the other class already wants a change to come; they need convincing because they’re already well-off in the current system; and because they, having the power, by definition, have the ability to bring about the change, or enable it, and those without power can’t do much. It is not only the very rich who have power, as a large force of poor ones can be powerful too. But violence seems unnecessary.
/# Within the two groups, are those who listen and reason, and those who don’t. Those who don’t, they are irrelevant, as no matter what I say, they will either not listen, or even if they do listen, they won’t really listen because of their own inability to reason.

/^‘If you have your Why? of life, you can put up with just about any How?’ - Friedrich Nietzsche
/^If you understand why you want to struggle and put in the effort to achieve something, you can put up with just about any difficulty or problem, however, if no convincing cause is there, you will not find it worth achieving and thus, it will become highly unlikely that you achieve it. As Elon Musk puts it, “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.” The significance of doing something because it is necessary is also demonstrated in the movie, “Interstellar,” in the famous docking scene.

/Human nature:
# “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” - The Theory of Moral Sentiments
# Opposition from those in power: accounting for the self-interest of those in power will make a system more likely to be established, simply because they will support it.
# The question you should be asking yourself is, “What do I really want?” Is it really just the materialistic pleasures? Or do you want something deeper than that? Do you not want to connect with the world, your fellow humans, and *actually* live? What does it mean to you to *actually* and *truly* live? Can Rewardism not help you get to your ideal world? And can it not help you better than any other economic system?

/Real wealth:
# "Labour remains the real price: money prices are just nominal prices. We buy in from others things that it would cost us more toil and trouble to do for ourselves. The real wealth that we obtain from exchanging with others is their labor, not their money." {use this quote for promoting the idea that money is not important but people and their activities so if we can promote good activities using reward-based system it would be better than people doing weird stuff to get money}
# Even if you say that you can get work done by AI, you still would need humans for the “human stuff” — mainly art. And real wealth is not how much money you have in the bank, but what you obtain from exchanging with others —the experience, the art, the love, and that which you cannot do yourself.

/The Big Forgiveness:
# No matter how you earned your income. Let us forgive and forget, and move on to a better world.

/Inheritance:
# Would’ve completely removed inheritance but this might be too big of a sudden change. Maybe later in future we can bring a new patch that removes the feature of inheritance. Main purpose of removing it is to ensure assets are with those who have rightfully earned them or can best utilize them. Nevertheless, I do not think it will be considered an essential feature of Rewardism, so, although I recommend that the concept of inheritance be slowly taken away, it is not necessary for a Rewardist region to not allow inheritance.

/Capital Gains:
# Problem at Hand: People can just buy assets they think will rise in value, and sell when their value rises, making income by just benefiting from the change in price. In other words, making RPs without actually putting in any effort. At this point, we must be aware of two significant risks: Bribery; and money-laundering. Consider the following example:
  A person X wants to bribe Y—a key decision-maker. Y has a painting that he bought for just $20. Without proper control procedures in place to manage the risk of money-laundering or bribery, the painting could be revalued at $20M. X could buy the asset from Y, and Y would, rightfully, get the 20 million. Interestingly, this would be recorded as a legitimate transaction in the accounts of both X, and Y.
  This highlights the danger of a lack of appropriate control procedures. 
# Why no CG:
- When people look at someone wealthy, do they really think, “This guy must have done a lot of good for the world?” Differentiating the actually talented and useful people who actually put in the effort from others. Being wealthy under Rewardism means something really worth rewarding has been done. Higher transparency by clear records is likely to strengthen trust in the wealthy ones. {contrast with using meaningless ways to get rich, and how two rich people are not necessarily of the same value in Capitalism. Connect point to a natural tendency to connect with fellow humans, and being valued.}
- The reason for putting a cap is to prevent the unnecessary increase in price of assets, and to prevent people from making money without putting in any real effort.
- So long as risk is concerned for companies, this is not that significant anymore as pseudo-debt is involved, and not the owners' own money.
- So long as risk is concerned for individuals, they ought to transfer this risk to more experienced companies, and earn RPs through more reliable and valuable methods.
- Just like no one should be able to reward themselves, likewise, no one should be able to value their own assets. This applies to authorized professional valuers as well. This is necessary to deal with the significant threat to objectivity. Also, this is likely to help us avoid the problems associated with behavioral biases like “Endowment Bias”—ascribing more value to assets already owned, and “Anchoring Bias”—clinging to arbitrary price levels.

/Property:
#| “The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security.” {on the significance of security of property, and the role of the government} <-- does not mean it is a bad system, for people to accumulate capital, they must have confidence that their property, which may take years of effort to acquire, will not be stolen from them. And this capital accumulation is essential for economic growth.

/Superintending and Directing:
# “The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.” {on the significance of liberty and non-interference} => Explain how it is possible to direct it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.

/Debt Repayment:
# Repaying debt of people feels unfair to those without any debt obligation: Think of it like being either sick, normal or very healthy. Treating the sick to make them normal is not really unfair to those who are already normal or very healthy. Those who are given the RPs for the debt owed to them are just being given what they were owed, so it's not a point of concern.

/Company Standards:
# Standards set for companies are not to make them all the same, it's to reduce the likelihood of underperformance occurring. Strictness of adhering to standards depends on the nature of business. In some businesses, meeting standards would be appreciated and rewarded, but not necessarily required.

/Infinitude: (Written in Q&A)
# The infinite Points at the disposal of the WRMO is not necessarily an issue because the system has been designed to avoid wastage. Think of the games again, while the game currency is effectively infinite, the games are designed with a difficulty level that makes players play carefully. While a perpetuity goes on for infinity, given a discount rate of 10%, there is a finite present value.
# Since companies have to cover the BPs they spend to stay alive, they will themselves not ask for more BPs than they can cover.
# Since companies are rewarded for keeping costs and prices low, they will themselves not waste their BPs.
# Since people cannot reward themselves, and every reward has a reason associated with it, excessive rewarding seems unlikely.
# At the end, it all boils down to what difficulty level the Economists set. The higher the difficulty, the more *worth it* the rewards will be, and the more careful entities will be with the finite resources they have.

/Against Kafkaesqueness
! You probably want things to not be as Kafkaesque.
! Wouldn’t you like taxes to go away?  No more taxes! Much less Kafkaesque environment. 
! No more stock market related problems, better source of funding, more bold decisions. 
! Don’t you want to have the freedom to make decisions, i.e., without the interference of creditors and equityholders? Yes, the RMs will replace the equityholders, and you would be answerable to them, but you will likely have more freedom, especially since the type of capital is psuedodebt. 
! High research costs bankrupting perfectly competitive firms in Capitalism, but this isn't a big deal in Rewardism, as investments are treated differently for performance appraisal reasons. 
!| Some countries have attempted to outlaw the lending of money at interest. But this has simply increased the evil of usury, rather than preventing it. People still want to borrow money, but now they have to pay not just the interest, but a premium for the risk that the creditor runs in lending illegally. {how Rewardism deals better with the problems of debt} 
!| Private capitals would certainly suffer greatly if all the costs of a war had to be raised through tax rises at the time (though it might make wars shorter, less popular, and less likely to happen). {possible reasons for war: lending, interest, profits... Reduced cause for war in Rewardism} R: Money creation through activity rather than lending.

/Universal Basic Income:
# (Why not just solve everything by a UBI?) Give reference to UBI (Kurzgesagt’s video about it); how your concept is different from it, the possible problems with UBI and how your concept can deal with those problems: money would mean possibility of spending on unnecessary goods, the root problem still would exist _ money corrupting and causing impurity.

/A New Game:
# If nothing else convinces you, perhaps: the excitement of a new playground, and the interesting principle.

/# On Globalization {And what better resource than an intellectual? It is also said that a very wise and famous scientist among you, Mr. Albert Einstein, considered himself as a world citizen. Here, let me help you peek into his interview, by George Sylvester Viereck, through this excerpt of The Saturday Evening Post:
  “ Do you look upon yourself as a German
or as a Jew?"
  “ It is quite possible," Einstein replied,
“to be both. I look upon myself as a man.
Nationalism is an infantile disease.   It is
the measles of mankind." /End of excerpt
  ‘But what does globalization have to do with helping countries drowning in debt?’, you ask? Ask yourself: ‘Can your left hand owe anything to your right hand? Can your body function optimally if some part of it is denied energy or very important nutrients?’ To really understand the importance of true globalization, you must consider the whole world and all the conscious beings as a single entity; then, you should understand how the suffering of even the smallest part of it is saddening and wrong; then, you should realize how much the success of others is important for your own success. To better understand this point, take the most developed country in the world and consider the whole world to be that one country, just with access to more resources.} R: One Org with all the info of economy is better suited to make adjustments. All sales data, and so on... Much more reliable data. The WRMO as a platform for Economists to control the economy. Why should leaders of nations decide to adopt this system and become one with the international nation: access to resources from around the globe and a better and well-thought-out system with international support and standards.

# Give a summary of the ideal form of Rewardism. {The One Mango Tree: What if there was just one mango tree with limited mangoes. Compare control and distribution in the two systems: Capitalism and Rewardism. Capitalism: - Controlled by the richest and fiercest. Mangoes sold to the highest bidder. Rewardism: - Controlled by the wisest and sincerest. Mangoes given to the most deserving. (link with proper system of rewarding ensuring that buyers actually deserve rewards, and not just by flipping NFTs; also, link with the reader not being the fiercest or richest, but being the one who can best utilize the resources.)}

# While some aspects of Economics are intuitively understood, it is, more or less, dependent on empirical evidence. So, the true effects of Rewardism can only be known from empirical evidence, and shall be tuned accordingly.

# Prelude to a System of The Future {* Overcome the selfish side.
* Even if we evolved from doing barter trade to using fiat currency, do we not still ask: “What is in it for me?”
* Consider Oneness, and work for the greater good.
* Consider shifting to a system that does not have to appeal to our selfish side for it to work.}
