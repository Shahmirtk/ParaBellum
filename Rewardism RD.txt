# := Relevant to Chapter 8: Why Rewardism

[
Approach:
# Write why the two classes would want Rewardism implemented, from their PoV. There being two groups of people sitting in front of you in an auditorium, the reader sitting in the group relevant to him. Start by adressing the small group of people, the “ruling class.” Explain why it is important to convince them first: mainly, because it is actually they who need convincing, the other class already wants a change to come; they need convincing because they’re already well-off in the current system; and because they, having the power, by definition, have the ability to bring about the change, or enable it, and those without power can’t do much. It is not only the very rich who have power, as a large force of poor ones can be powerful too. But learning from the history of class struggle, and what happened with Communism, it is better to avoid that route of violence.
# Within the two groups, are those who listen and reason, and those who don’t. Those who don’t, they are irrelevant, as no matter what I say, they will either not listen, or even if they do listen, they won’t really listen because of their own inability to reason.
# Keep the Explanation of Rewardism in mind when writing. Explain why you made Rewardism this way, and not some other way.
# Take the cons of both Capitalism and Communism, and explain how Rewardism deals with them.
# Take the pros of both Capitalism and Communism, and explain how Rewardism accounts for them.

Purpose of economic system:
# The total wealth/resources of the world are finite and no man can increase that really. The task of the economist is then to utilize and spread these resources and this wealth in the best possible way. {from CWoN?}
# "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer." {on the significance of giving preference to consumers over producers}

Real wealth:
# "Labour remains the real price: money prices are just nominal prices. We buy in from others things that it would cost us more toil and trouble to do for ourselves. The real wealth that we obtain from exchanging with others is their labor, not their money." {use this quote for promoting the idea that money is not important but people and their activities so if we can promote good activities using reward-based system it would be better than people doing weird stuff to get money}  
# Money is a utensil, just like pots and pans. The fact that wealth and money are separate things can be shown quite easily. After all, a person who receives a guinea of income today may spend that same guinea tomorrow, thus providing the income of a second; and that person may spend the same guinea on the next day, providing the income of a third. So, the amount of money in circulation is clearly much less than the total income of the nation. National income is the quantity of goods bought and sold, not the metal pieces that happen to be used to facilitate the exchange of that product. {highlight significance of activity over money} 

Human nature (against cynicism):
# �How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.� - The Theory of Moral Sentiments
# "A man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants." {on the significance of doing your work yourself}
# Opposition from those in power: accounting for the self-interest of those in power will make a system more likely to be established, simply because they will support it.

The One Mango Tree
# What if there was just one mango tree with limited mangoes. Compare control and distribution in the two systems: Capitalism and Rewardism. Capitalism: - Controlled by the richest and fiercest. Mangoes sold to the highest bidder. Rewardism: - Controlled by the wisest and sincerest. Mangoes given to the most deserving.

Not a Competitor to the USD:
#
• Pegged to USD first (in USA, the USA's version of RP), so value of the USD is what will give it value.
• USA can be the leader in adopting Rewardism. Can transfer US currency from a fragile sand castle to a robust fortress. No need to think of the RP as a competitor. What's in a name? RPs can be the new USD.
• World-wide acceptance of Rewardism can make USA a proud leader of a new system.
• It is paramount to respect the power of the most powerful in a kingdom. It is only after being the most admired of the king, can you expect to be the heir to the throne. RP is not a king that wants to compete with another king, it wants to be the successor.
• "The king is dead, long live the king."

Directing:
# �The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.� {on the significance of liberty and non-interference} => Explain how it is possible to direct it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society, and why the government shouldn’t interfere (the WRMO representing the private affairs, seperate from the gov, but answerable to it).

The Conversion From Non-Rewardist Country Problem:
#What Exactly The Restrictions Are: Mainly, can't do anything that results in income without doing anything *valuable*, and can't allow the problems of debt to rise again.
#Why These Restrictions: No debt related problems if no such thing as debt. Besides, companies already get pseudo-debt, which shall be enough for meeting expenses. So, there is no need for debt. People don't need debt, because there's the concept of Installments/Rent for more expensive assets, and their necessities are accounted for freely. A share in a company's income is what you deserve for putting in the effort, and for starting the company in the first place, or simply for your idea. With no need for funding from investors, there would be no need to put up a share on a stock market. You can't just buy a share of a company you didn't start. Does it not make sense that people's *Rewards* should increase only by an activity that is *worth rewarding*?
#The Problem at Hand: People can just move to a non-Rewardist country, earn income in the old and unchanged environment, and effectively convert that money to RPs. Similar case with companies. People can also avoid losing inheritance by moving to a non-Rewardist country.
#Why This is a Problem: You're trying to restrict people to get wealthy only by doing valuable things. In other words, you're trying to prevent people from being *rewarded* for activities *not worth rewarding*. But they can just avoid those restrictions in non-Rewardist countries, and come back later; making the restrictions meaningless, more or less. You're trying to prevent people from getting wealth they haven't really earned. But they can just get their wealth in another country.
#Possible Solutions: 
Basically, the solution is that we're interested in *how* you earned the money you're trying to convert, or how you received the asset you're trying to get registered. If you can prove its fairness, and we are satisfied, we will allow you to convert the money, or get the asset registered.
- I will have to discuss with the pros how to solve this problem. 
- If the whole world became Rewardist, there would be no place to flee to for the purpose of getting wealthier by *non-kosher* means.
- It should be noted that the powers of the WRMO are restricted to Rewardist countries. What the non-Rewardist ones do cannot really be controlled by the WRMO. So, any control procedure must account for the level of control the WRMO has. A person that wishes to no longer be in a Rewardist country will not be the matter of WRMO. For a non-Rewardist person to get the nationality of a Rewardist country, there will be restrictions on how much wealth can be converted to RPs. For a non-Rewardist company to open a branch in a Rewardist country, they will be treated as a new company and there will be restrictions on how much wealth of the non-Rewardist company can be converted to BPs. Basically, whatever wealth is supported by evidence of being earned in a way considered fair by the WRMO will be convertible, rest like loans and money earned through capital gains, would be considered nonconvertible. If anyone's guest arrives into a Rewardist country from a non-Rewardist country, they can bring in their luggage, and get a profile made here, which shall have some NPs and they would have their ID, both of which can be used to access products and services of necessities. They can also convert wealth that is allowed to be converted for purchasing items of luxuries.
- As Adam Smith would want, there should be almost no restrictions on international trade. Non-Rewardist ones would still be able to buy the products and services of the Rewardist countries that are available for purchase internationally, which shall be in control of the WRMO for reasons such as maintaining quality, and preventing illegal sales.

Against profligacy:
# The first remedy for self-neglect and profligacy is the study of science and philosophy. The second is to amuse and divert people by promoting the arts. {on the significance of art, science and philosophy} => Explain how to deal with very high buying power and demand.

Repaying debt:
# So capital is being transferred from people who have a keen interest in using it productively to those, mere creditors, who have no interest in the condition of land or the good management of the capital stock at all. <Move to Cons of Capitalism?>
# Repaying debt of people feels unfair to those without any debt obligation: Think of it like being either sick, normal or very healthy. Treating the sick to make them normal is not really unfair to those who are already normal or very healthy. Those who are given the RPs for the debt owed to them are just being given what they were owed, so it's not a point of concern.

The Capital Gains Problem:
# Problem at Hand: People can just buy assets they think will rise in value, and sell when their value rises, making income by just benefiting from the change in price. In other words, making RPs without actually putting in any effort. At this point, we must be aware of two significant risks: Bribery; and money-laundering. Consider the following example:
  A person X wants to bribe Y—a key decision-maker. Y has a painting that he bought for just $20. Without proper control procedures in place to manage the risk of money-laundering or bribery, the painting could be revalued at $20M. X could buy the asset from Y, and Y would, rightfully, get the 20 million. Interestingly, this would be recorded as a legitimate transaction in the accounts of both X, and Y.
  This highlights the danger of a lack of appropriate control procedures. 
# Why no CG:
- The reason for putting a cap is to prevent the unnecessary increase in price of assets, and to prevent people from making money without putting in any real effort.
- So long as risk is concerned for companies, this is not that significant anymore as pseudo-debt is involved, and not the owners' own money.
- So long as risk is concerned for individuals, they ought to transfer this risk to more experienced companies, and earn RPs through more reliable and valuable methods.
- Just like no one should be able to reward themselves, likewise, no one should be able to value their own assets. This applies to authorized professional valuers as well. This is necessary to deal with the significant threat to objectivity. Also, this is likely to help us avoid the problems associated with behavioral biases like “Endowment Bias”—ascribing more value to assets already owned, and “Anchoring Bias”—clinging to arbitrary price levels.

COMPARISON WITH UBI:
#Give reference to UBI (Kurzgesagt’s video about it); how your concept is different from it, the possible problems with UBI and how your concept can deal with those problems: money would mean possibility of spending on unnecessary goods, the root problem still would exist _ money corrupting and causing impurity.

Pros of Rewardism:
# Mention that Economics, while some aspects of it being rationalist, is more or less, an empirical field. So, the true effects of Rewardism can only be known from empirical evidence, and shall be tuned accordingly.
# Seperation of responsibilities will allow both (government and WRMO) to focus on their specific ones and better perform.
#| Indeed, the system of perfect liberty leaves the state only three duties to attend to: defence, justice and certain public works. {Contrast the role of government with that of the WRMO, and how this is beneficial.}
#| “The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security.” {on the significance of security of property, and the role of the government}
#| “Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.” <-- does not mean it is a bad system, for people to accumulate capital, they must have confidence that their property, which may take years of effort to acquire, will not be stolen from them. And this capital accumulation is essential for economic growth.
# The WRMO as a platform for Economists to control the economy.
# Not using personal capital, so willing to take higher risks, and managers can a lot some time for the company to recover. With own capital, people might not want to face losses, so, good companies in difficult times might not live to recover. More support by the WRMO can lead to improvements in the supply chain, as suppliers would expect the company to continue.
# No more stock market related problems, better sources of funding, more bold decisions.
#| Some countries have attempted to outlaw the lending of money at interest. But this has simply increased the evil of usury, rather than preventing it. People still want to borrow money, but now they have to pay not just the interest, but a premium for the risk that the creditor runs in lending illegally. {how Rewardism deals better with the problems of debt}
#| Private capitals would certainly suffer greatly if all the costs of a war had to be raised through tax rises at the time (though it might make wars shorter, less popular, and less likely to happen). {possible reasons for war: lending, interest, profits... Reduced cause for war in Rewardism}
# Would’ve completely removed inheritance but this might be too big of a sudden change. Maybe later in future we can bring a new patch that removes the feature of inheritance. Main purpose of removing it is to ensure assets are with those who have rightfully earned them or can best utilize them.
# Shifted focus from revenue to activity.
# Activity: One café sells 100 cups, another sells 30. One makes revenue of 100, other makes a revenue of 120. Higher activity is that of 100, not 120 one.
# Utility: If the reviews of the 100 one are better than that of 30 one, then the utility of 100 one is more.

Pros of Rewardism:
# Ask reader to imagine a world where basic needs are fulfilled no matter what, and being rewarded reward points. How that would be better and what problems could arise. Why are reward points necessary, why is differentiation needed, how reward points would not give rise to (or reduce the possibility of) corruption, and be a cause for great effects (explain how rewarding reward points will act as a cause for promotion of important activities), how it will address the problem of lack of motivation to work hard, and it would differentiate between those working hard and those who do not care about the society, why basic needs should be fulfilled for free, why transparency in transactions and sources of reward points is necessary (increased authenticity and value of reward points) in order to ensure no one tries to get the reward points illegally. (Explain benefits- purity, less possibility of making bad decisions/corruption, more focused on important things like research and protecting the environment and important resources, making new inventions to help the society, compatible with AI taking over humans’ jobs, easy to manipulate the general public in to doing things in the best interest of everyone by setting the reward points available accordingly.) Explain how deep the benefits of this system go by explaining the long-term effects. (Increase in the “deepness” of mankind. Not worrying about trivial things like survival and accumulating wealth; instead focusing on growth and actually living. *Mention reaching different galaxies, living in harmony, and finding true wealth: knowledge.)
# what is in it for the normal: chance to truly enjoy their life and reach their max potential, compensated for their assets by giving them reward points likewise. -why should leaders of nations decide to adopt this system and become one with the international nation: access to resources from around the globe and a better and well-thought-out system with international support and standards;
# *Explain how your method differs from the Communists in the sense that we are not going at war against the bourgeoisie but against the old ways and so asking for the help of the bourgeoisie in doing so.
#| Decent wages are essential for the well-being of labourers and their families. But to pay decent wages is in the interests of employers, too. When wages are high, workers are better fed and stronger. They also have the prospect of saving and improving their condition, which makes them more inclined to work diligently. And when workers are given sufficient rest, they are likely to be healthier and more productive. {link this with the significance of rewarding generously, and how Rewardism helps avoid drastically low levels of income}
# <Employment Income> {link these points to the basis on which people should be rewarded} The non-pecuniary costs and benefits of different industries: 
  ->	Some professions may be easier, cleaner, or more respectable than others.
  ->	Some professions are difficult or expensive to learn. 
  ->	Some trades are seasonal. 
  ->	Earnings are higher in trades that require a large degree of trust (doctors, lawyers, etc.).
  ->	Earnings reflect the probability of success in any profession (rarity and beauty of talents in professions like acting, singing, etc.).
#| “Public services are never better performed than when their reward comes in consequence of their being performed, and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them.” <Link to reward-based system.>
# <Public Officals> �The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or less the necessity of application in the teachers Their subsistence [is] altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions� {on the significance of performance-based rewards} 
# <Public Officals>  �... and it has, I am afraid, been too common for vessels to fit out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty.� <this is particularly relevant to setting the reward appropriately>

I would like you to compare the money-based system with the perfect economic system that I have hopefully created clearly in your mind. Carefully analyse how the two are different and why there are such differences.
If these needs are accounted for successfully, child mortality rate should decrease and the physical and mental health of the population should improve generally. If you are properly educated, you are more likely to advance to great heights because you are more likely to understand what great heights are and their importance and also how to get there.
I want you to imagine what such a system should be like, what must change in the present system, and what kind of world do you want to live in with your loved ones? More importantly think about ‘why’ such changes are necessary.
‘If you have your Why? of life, you can put up with just about any How?’ - Friedrich Nietzsche
If you humans understand why you want to struggle and put in the effort to achieve something, you can put up with just about any difficulty or problem, however, if no convincing cause is there, you will not find it worth achieving and thus, it will become very difficult for you to achieve it. Another factor that plays an important role in achieving just about anything is hope, because even if you know why something has to change but have no hope of achieving it, you are unlikely to put in the necessary effort; without hope you are most likely to think ‘what is the point of all my effort, people do not change, nothing will change’. Having a reason and hope to change the world to make it worth living in will help you greatly in bringing about that change.
  As this should be the base standard of living of everyone, nobody should be left out because of factors like his/her financial status, gender, ethnicity, religion etc. deal with this weakness in such a way that its benefits such as how it incentivizes productivity and innovation are retained; ‘Don’t throw the baby with the bathwater’, if you may. After all, if you get rid of money completely, how will you differ between those who do meaningful work and those who do not care?
  Such a currency is unlikely to cause people to become immoral because achieving it through a dishonest manner is going to be very difficult and not without consequences; rather, it is likely to cause people to do more meaningful work for maintaining and improving the world. I do not see how it would be easy to bribe someone or do corruption in this system, especially because these activities rely heavily on transferring and hiding money; similarly, money laundering would become impossible as it is really the act of hiding the source of money. Though I know you humans, you will still find a way; nevertheless, the wise must strive to prevent evil.
  And what better resource than an intellectual? It is also said that a very wise and famous scientist among you, Mr. Albert Einstein, considered himself as a world citizen. Here, let me help you peek into his interview, by George Sylvester Viereck, through this excerpt of The Saturday Evening Post:
  “ Do you look upon yourself as a German
or as a Jew?"
  “ It is quite possible," Einstein replied,
“to be both. I look upon myself as a man.
Nationalism is an infantile disease.   It is
the measles of mankind."
  ‘But what does globalization have to do with helping countries drowning in debt?’, you ask? Ask yourself: ‘Can your left hand owe anything to your right hand? Can your body function optimally if some part of it is denied energy or very important nutrients?’ To really understand the importance of true globalization, you must consider the whole world and all the conscious beings as a single entity; then, you should understand how the suffering of even the smallest part of it is sad and wrong; then, you should realize how much the success of others is important for your own success.
  To better understand this point, take the most developed country in the world and consider the whole world to be that one country, just with access to more resources. The reward-based system deals with the negative side of consumerism easily because ideally, only meaningful work is rewarded. Considering the preciousness of reward points and the unavailability of meaningless services & products, you humans wasting your hard-earned reward points seems unlikely to me. Furthermore, the resources managers must try their best to minimize excessive consumption, so that the maximum number of people can benefit from the limited resources.
