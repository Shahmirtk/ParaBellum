*New Company or Division Registration
Must register as RP or NP or ID based. CE limit set according to nature of business and possibly higher in first year for purchase of assets. Employees and owners must be registered for rewarding and other purposes.

Employees must not have overlapping time with with other businesses and no more than 16 hours of work per day. So, must register time of working.

Registered companies should all have the same accounting period (accounting and fiscal is same now). They should be reviewable in the dedicated app. The employees should be too. Each region and each division should be treated as a separate company for performance measures.


*Root of problems
Ignorance, not money. Ideal Capitalism without ignorance is better than Ideal Communism and Rewardism with ignorance.

Solution to ignorance: valuing objectivity and truth.


*The One Mango Tree
What if there was just one mango tree with limited mangoes. Compare control and distribution in the two systems: Capitalism and Rewardism.

• Capitalism: Controlled by the richest and fiercest. Mangoes sold to the highest bidder.

• Rewardism: Controlled by the wisest and sincerest. Mangoes given to the most deserving.


*Performance measures
A company's average rating, expenses and revenue will be taken into account when deciding reward points to be given. Profit is irrelevant but there should be no loss or negligible loss.

For companies with products and/or services available over a huge geographical area, the performance will be measured for a shorter region (a city, two cities, a state, etc.).

There should be a dedicated app for reviews and reports where only customers can review or report companies.

Performance should be measured for each accounting period (6 months, 9 months, etc.). Performance auditors should audit each accounting period to identify any fraud or poor performance.

Performance measurements should be recorded over the years and judgements made accordingly. For consecutive high performance periods, a bonus can be given.


*NP, RP, CP, ID Cards
• NP: Necessity Points used for buying necessities such as food, sanitary items, etc.

• RP: Reward Points used for buying luxury items and services.

• CE: Company Points used for buying items and services for running company. Assets expensed according to depreciation per period. Other expenses expensed fully.

• ID: Identity Card used for public services such as Health Care, Public Transport, Education, etc.

Thumb, Retinal and/or OTP verification necessary for transactions.

Points burned, not transfered.

Each transaction recorded in each Person's and Business's account.


*Reward factor
Multiplier according to risk and significance of job. Example: Surgeon.multiplier = 20 and Painter.multiplier = 1.2. Base reward same for everyone. Example base reward: 1 point per accounting period. 1 iPhone's price = 10 points. Multiplier multiplied by reward from employment or business. Reward from employment or business dependent on the performance of business.


*Role of politicians
• Acting as middlemen between decision makers (scientists and philosophers) and the public.
• They deal with people all the time so they're most experienced for this role.
• It's one thing to deal with numbers and another to deal with people.


*TPSystem
• Elders' contribution: People with 'enough' free time contributing ideas and their knowledge regarding whatever they specialize in or are interested in. - 'Non-annoying' method used to take benefit of their knowledge and experience to make improvements.
• Account for loneliness problem with the new urges-relief system. - Emotionally connected with only the one committed to, not attached with sex partners (just like not with food) but still enjoy the process (like eating). - Training and Counselling sessions for helping partners in supporting each other (especially in tough times) - Profile of people maintained to indicate status of diseases and 'satisfaction rating' (cleanliness, size, previous sex-partners' reviews regarding 'doing as told' and niceness). 


*Para Bellum
Unsorted ideas: 
• "Productivity Enhancement Room" in design of houses for individuals: solitude, silence, inspirational room.
• "Disliked jobs" automated as much as possible so that least amount of people have to do such jobs.

Reasoning system: 
• should take responsibility of research work, including the effects of "pleasure-seeking activities". On the basis of the research done, and the reasoning and the deductions from it, guidance should be provided to the Relief system. 
• "Big decisions" can only be taken after approval from the leaders of the Reasoning System. The leaders can interfere in other decisions too if they have grounds to believe that the decision is very unreasonable.
