>>> Resource Allocation

  Introduction
    By resource, I mean a fundamental element which is used in the production of a good or for the provision of a service. “To which fundamental level must one break down an object to get to this fundamental element?” One might ask. Arguably the building block of the universe, if there is such a thing, is what should be called the resource, as that is what, by definition, every product is made up of, and essentially that is what is being used to provide a service; however, since it is not feasible, at least at the time of writing this, to create any object we wish out of the building block, we have to stop at the level where further breakdown would result in elements which cannot really be used or where further actual, as opposed to conceptual, breakdown is not reasonable. Reasonability of breakdown depends on whether the further breakdown of the object is preferrable over the use of the object as it is.
    Take for example, a computer. A computer is itself a product and can be used to provide a range of services. But the computer is not really a resource as it can be broken down into processor, ram, etc. Those components can then be further broken down, until we have copper, silicon, etc. These elements are the real resources because further breakdown is likely to be irreversible, and because these elements can be used to make not just a computer, but other products. For practical reasons, however, a computer might be considered as a resource if the breakdown of the computer is not reasonable. What fundamental level must be considered, depends on the scenario then. So, when considering the available resources, an economist can think in terms of both the availability of silicon, and the availability of computers.
    Resource allocation is not limited to the allocation of a resource to the right company, but also to the right cause, and to the right era. Allocation to the right company is necessary because even if you allocate a resource to the right cause and era, the wrong company will not be able to utilize it properly. The right company, then, is that company which knows how to optimally utilize the resource, mainly because of its experience with the same or similar resources and associated projects. The right cause is the highest cause, that which has the highest significance according to its urgency and potential for impact on the world. The right era is the era till which the resource must be preserved, for mainly the reason that the resource is scarce, and earlier consumption will deprive future generations of access to it. Since, with time technology generally improves, it is better to wait for technology to advance enough to utilize the scarce resource optimally.

  [Note: Resources mentioned in the explanation of this division refer to the resources of the Rewardist countries, unless mentioned otherwise. Also, the ideal experts are the same in the Resource Allocation division and all its sub-divisions.]

  Main Purpose:
  * “To govern the resource allocation process.”

  * Communicating the different necessities, desires, their respective rankings, and the standards to the leaders of the RMs, and educating them about the best practices of resource allocation.
  * Communicating with its sub-divisions to get a clear picture of the state of the resource allocation process. This state includes:
    > what, and where, resources are, or will be, available,
    > how resources have been allocated, and used so far,
    > what the results of past allocations are, and whether they are better, equal, or worse than expected,
    > what the intended future use of resources is,
    > the opportunity costs, and
    > how satisfied people and governments are with the services of the RMs.
  * Further optimizing the resource allocation process according to the analysis and evaluation of the information received from the sub-divisions, while keeping in mind the previous decisions made, and their results.
