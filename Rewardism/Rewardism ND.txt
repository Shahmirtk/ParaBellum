Q. How will the Points get their value?
A. "And it is a mistake to imagine that wealth resides only in money. Money is just a medium of exchange. It is useful, because everyone accepts it. Yet what people actually want when they do accept it is not the money, but the things that they can buy with the money. Certainly, gold and silver have the merit of being more durable than some other commodities, and this adds to their usefulness as a store of value. But durability is not everything: we are perfectly happy to import wine from France and send them hardware in exchange. Nevertheless, the French are not so stupid as to amass more pots and pans than they need to cook their food, just because they are more durable. It would be a complete waste of resources. By the same token, neither we, nor any country, should seek to amass more gold and silver than is needed to facilitate trade. It would be a waste too – dead capital that would come out of the available resources we need to feed, clothe, maintain and employ the people. Money is a utensil, just like pots and pans." - The Condensed Wealth of Nations, Page 48

  "I’m not sure if this question is coming from the angle of the popular idea that the dollar isn’t backed by anything. Typically, the question is considered to be rhetorical, and the supposed answer is supposed to shock us into realizing that the entire American economy is a house of cards built on a sand castle.
  Whether or not that is the intent of the question, know that this is not true. The dollar has value, whether or not there is such-and-such an amount of gold in some building somewhere. Try this thought-experiment that will clarify where the value of the dollar is ultimately established.
  Imagine a scenario in which the entire economy uses, say, Dogecoin. One day, the US Federal government passes a law that for whatever reason requires every person to send a the president a cupcake for his birthday. And furthermore, that cupcake must be obtained from an authorized government bake shop. The law provides some kind of penalty for failure to send a cupcake in.
  What will be the effect of this provision on the economy? Well, people will want to acquire a cupcake in order to comply with the law. Where can you get it, and how? Well, if you have one of these special government-allowed cupcakes, fine. If you have two, you might want to give it to someone else so they can meet their own legal obligations. Soon, there will be those who will sell authorized cupcakes to people. And people will barter work, Dogecoin, and other goods for them. Doubtless, some people will borrow or steal them.
  In this scenario, cupcakes have become valuable. But interestingly, they have become valuable to people who may not even like cupcakes. To those people, there is no intrinsic value to cupcakes; yet they still will be desperate to acquire them. And anyone with an excess — even if they think that inventory is worthless — will consider bartering them for other valuable things.
  Often overlooked, this is the ultimate source of the dollar’s value. You can use gold and private bartering all you want, but at some point the law requires you to send dollars to the federal government. Thus you need to get some. And so, they become valuable whether or not you particularly care for them as dirty pieces of linen.
  As you can see, dollars will remain as valuable as the law makes them through 1) the requirements of the tax code and 2) the limited supply allowed into circulation. With both of these backed by the threat of legal sanctions. That value will remain as long as there is a federal government to enforce those provisions." - Anonymous, Quora, "What is backing the American dollar?"

  Since, "Money is just a medium of exchange. It is useful, because everyone accepts it.", what really gives money its value is not the commodity backing it, but trust in the governing body authorizing it. In other words, a currency has value because some powerful people say so. How that value changes over time depends on a lot of factors, but perhaps the most important one is how difficult it is to get that currency. If you have to work hard to get a currency, that is obviously going to be much more valuable than if you could just print that currency for yourself.
  One might think that something with a potentially infinite supply cannot really have any value. However, the problem is in the interpretation of the word supply. Supply does not just mean whether one can make more of something out of thin air, it also accounts for whether that thing is accessible. So, even if the Points are potentially infinite, it is the fact that they are not easy to get is what makes them valuable. That is why, no one should be able to have the power of giving anyone any point for no reason. Not even the ones running the system should be able to do so.
  - Aren't NPs worthless if they are given without any effort: No, limited fixed supply. Limited purchasing. Has value for NP related businesses. Can be accepted by NP businesses to get something more valuable: RPs. Since, it is accepted, then it has value.
  - How would you keep the value of RPs under control if you're going to give away so many for ending debt: Initially it will be a fixed value, like 1 RP = 100 USD, then after 3 years of the system being in place, an extra amount will be given if there is any drop in the value of the RPs. This way the Creditors will be given a justified amount and they will have more trust in the system.
