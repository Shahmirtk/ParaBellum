A. "In general, if any branch of trade, or any division of labour, be advantageous to the public, the freer and more general the competition, it will always be the more so." - The Wealth Of Nations, Book II
  The question of utilization of foreign resources deals with the resources controlled by the WRMO, not the resources owned by individuals, companies or organizations. If a country A was rich with a resource X but lacked the talent to optimally utilize it, and a foreign country B had the talent and resources to optimally utilize the resource X, then ideally, B should be given access to the resource X. A would want something in return for giving access to the resource. But what if B had nothing substantial to offer in return? Should X be wasted? An economic system that allows wastage of a resource is clearly not the ideal economic system, as the whole point is to optimally utilize resources.
  RMs will have to consider the various possibilities of utilizing a resource, this includes the possibility of it being utilized by a foreign country. By communicating with foreign RMs and global economists, RMs should be able to identify the best use of a resource from an international perspective. To allow foreigners to utilize resources is to expose the locals to international competition and expertise. Readers of Adam Smith would know the significance of overcoming monopolies and enabling competition. Ideally, resources should be utilized by those who can best utilize them instead of those who happen to find them; practically however, governments would be able to intervene and give access to local people instead of foreigners.
  There are two main ways a resource can be utilized by a foriegn company. The resource can be transported to the foreign country and used there, or the resource can be used in the country where it is found. An easy way would be to treat the national branch of the multinational company like a local company, and give it access to the resource. However, if it is necessary to transport the resource out of the country, then the RMs, company representatives and government officials would have to discuss terms and come to an agreement. RMs would best fulfill their responsibilities by convincing the government officials and coming to a reasonable agreement from an economic perspective.
