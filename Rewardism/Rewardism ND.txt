Q. Why manually set rewarding formulas and factors when there is already the law of supply and demand?
A. "The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society." - The Wealth Of Nations, Book IV
  Even though Adam Smith had the idea that no one can really direct the industry of private people "towards employments most suitable to the interest of the society," by the use of these formulas and factors, I believe we can direct it. The economists will just have to increase the rewarding factor for industries and professions they find important, and the rest will happen quite automatically. Futhermore, this will likely safeguard people against extremely low rewards in case supply is much more than the demand.
