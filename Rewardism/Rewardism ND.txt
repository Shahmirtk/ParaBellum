Resource Allocation

  Introduction
    By resource, I mean a fundamental element which is used in the production of a good or the provision of a service. “To which fundamental level must one break down an object to get to this fundamental element?” One might ask. Arguably the building block of the universe, if there is such a thing, is what should be called the resource, as that is what, by definition, every product is made up of, and essentially that is what is being used to provide a service; however, since it is not feasible, at least at the time of writing this, to create any object we wish out of the building block, we have to stop at the level where further breakdown would result in elements which cannot really be used or where further breakdown is not reasonable. Reasonability of breakdown depends on whether the further breakdown of the object is preferrable over the use of the object as it is.
    Take for example, a computer. A computer is itself a product and can be used to provide a range of services. But the computer is not really a resource as it can be broken down into processor, ram, etc. Those components can then be further broken down, until we have copper, silicon, etc. These elements are the real resources because further breakdown is likely to be irreversible, and because these elements can be used to make not just a computer, but other products. For practical reasons, however, a computer might be considered as a resource if the breakdown of the computer is not reasonable. What fundamental level must be considered, depends on the scenario then. So, when considering the available resources, an economist can think in terms of both the availability of silicon, and the availability of computers.

  [Note: Resources mentioned in the explanation of this division refer to the resources of the Rewardist countries, unless mentioned otherwise. Also, the ideal experts are the same in the Resource Allocation division and all its sub-divisions.]

  Main Purpose:
  * “To govern the resource allocation process.”

  Responsible for:
  * Identifying the different needs of the world, and then ranking them according to their significance (importance and urgency).
  * Setting the standards for resource allocation such that the meeting of those standards results in resources being optimally utilized.
  * Communicating the needs identified and the standards set to the leaders of the RMs, and educating them about the best practices of resource allocation.
  * Communicating with its sub-divisions to get a clear picture of the state of resource allocation process. The state of resource allocation process includes what resources are, or will be, available and where, how resources have been utilized so far, what is the intended future use of resources, the opportunity costs, and how satisfied people are with the services of the RMs.
  * Further optimizing the resource allocation process after understanding the current state of resource allocation process, and the previous decisions made.

  Ideal Experts:
  * Experienced Economists
  * Experienced Financial Analysts
  * Experienced Investment Analysts
  * Experienced Stasticians
  * Experienced Programmers

  Sub-divisions:

  - Forecasts

  Main Purpose:
  * “To predict the availability of resources in the future by taking into account the rate of usage of the resources.”

  Responsible for:
  * Estimating the rate of production.
  * Estimating the rate of consumption.
  * Estimating the rate of 
  * Using the estimates and modern forecasting techniques to forecast the availability of resources in the future.

  - Reward Factors & Formulas

  Main Purpose:
  * “To identify the relevant factors, and to formulate ideal formulas, for rewarding purposes.”

  Responsible for:
  * Investigating which factors are relevant to rewarding, and which are irrelevant.
  * Using different models to estimate the appropriate weights of reward factors, where applicable.
  * Running simulations, doing scenario analyses, and running stress tests to find out the effects of reward factors and formulas on performance before implementing them.
  * Finding out the actual affect on the world of implementing the formulas.
  * Taking feedback from reasonable people about the effects of the formulas on their motivation and other aspects of life.
  * Reporting the findings to the main division.

  - Companies

  Main Purpose:
  * “To ensure that only the best companies utilize the resources, and to enable the new companies to rise.” 

  Responsible for:
  * Ensuring that uneconomical companies are not funded and economical ones are.
  * Reviewing performance of companies that were funded and acting accordingly.
  * Keeping a check on RMs.
  * Reporting performance of companies funded to the main division.
