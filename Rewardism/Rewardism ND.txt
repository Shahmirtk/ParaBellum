  You invite your friends to your wedding. One of your foreign friends, who lives in Capitalistan—a country that still follows the old cash-based system, calls you . “Hi, I am quite excited about your wedding and would love to be there. I am not so sure about how I will convert my money into Reward Points, though. Can you guide me?” she asks you on the phone. “Yeah, you should definitely come over. So, to get the RPs, you just gotta make an account online to get yourself a wallet, and then you can ask one of the authorized exchange companies to top up your wallet for whatever your currency is. It’s really that simple,” you answer. “Oh, so kinda like topping up Steam or my phone. Cool.”
  Before she hangs up, she asks you, “And what about when I’m leaving, will I be able to buy back my country’s currency?” “Yes, just like you would buy any other asset using RPs. They will be burned away from your account according to whatever the exchange rate is at the time; you will get your currency, and the activity will be recorded in both your and the exchange company’s profile,” you let her know. “So, I’m sorry if I’m asking too much on the phone, do they get equivalent RPs according to the activity?” “Yeah, more or less. It is quite interesting, so I’m happy to answer dear. I’m looking forward to meeting you.” “Same. Bye!” “Bye now!”
  ... You decide to expand your business further to countries without Rewardism. After two lengthy meetings with the RMs, you start trading internationally. A multi-currency account is opened for your company. BPs alloted to your company are burned to get the desired currencies for importing purposes. The activities are recorded in the relevant accounts. Options and futures are used to convert revenue earned in foreign currency to Points. The Points are recorded as normally activity is recorded. The number of Points earned are then compared to the number of BPs burned to assess your company’s performance, as usual. Foreign companies find your company’s services and products very economical.
  You find the use of hedge funds, options and futures very fruitful as your company finds its way in the global market. A financial institution handles such transactions for you as it is not the core competency of your company. For individuals and institutions from Rewardist countries, such transactions can only take place through authorized companies. Whenever such a transaction is confirmed, the relevant amount of funds of all parties to the transaction are locked to deal with credit and settlement risk. Indeed, this means that such transactions cannot occur without the funds to support them. This way, your company becomes a global leader for other Rewardist companies.
