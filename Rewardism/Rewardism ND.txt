Q. How on Earth will such a different currency sell on the currency exchange?! 
A: Specialized and authorized exchange guys. Dedicated systems.
Initial value issue (Peg to USD)
Subsequent value update issue (Basis: Performance of Rewardism)
Immune from Supply and Demand? (Potentially infinite supply, fixed price...)

Q. What if people want the other currencies a lot? What if sellers of other currencies do not want RPs (maybe because of limited usability)? Won't that result in a drop in value of RPs? A: Limited usability isn't a big deal when it comes to assets. They can be held just as investments. ([Done] Make RPs globally attainable. Just create account for person from nonRewardist country.)
