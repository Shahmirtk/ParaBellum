- Why does the RP of a region reflect the economy of that region?
A. Consider the following example,

t0: 1 RPa = 1 RPb = 1 Gs
t1: 1 RPa = 2 Gs, 1 RPb = 1 Gs
t1: 1 RPa = 2 RPb = 2 Gs

  Where:
RPa is the currency of country A,
RPb is the currency of country B, and where
Gs is a standard bar of gold.

  At t0, a reasonable person would be willing to buy 1 RPb for 1 RPa, because she can buy one standard bar of Gold with either of them. At t1, the same person would not be willing to buy 1 RPb for 1 RPa, because now she can buy 2 standard bars of Gold with 1 RPa but only 1 standard bar of Gold with 1 RPb. She would be willing to pay 1 RPa for 2 RPbs. So, the exchange rate has to reflect the economy of each region.

- How will the assets registers show the latest market values of assets?
A. At this point, we must be aware of a significant risk of both bribery, and money-laundering. To understand how we are exposed to these risks when it comes to the valuation of assets, consider the following example:

  A person X wants to bribe Y—a key decision-maker. Y has a painting that he bought for just 20 RPs. Without proper control procedures in place to manage money-laundering and bribery risks, the painting could be valued at 20 million RPs. Although X cannot directly transfer the RPs to Y, she can buy the asset from Y, and Y would, rightfully, get the 20 million. Interestingly, this would be recorded as a legitimate transaction in the profiles of both X, and Y.

  This highlights how significant it is to value assets objectively. Not only is there a need for a strong basis for the market value of an asset, there is also a need for auditing asset valuations and detecting anomolous market values. Audits are likely to deter professional asset valuers from valuing assets unfairly. Using modern data science tools and statistical tools can help detect anomolous market values, which can act as signals or indicators for auditors and investigators.
  If the asset, or a similar asset, is actively traded then the market value can be updated quite easily. For example, if the asset is a share that is traded on some stock exchange, the value of the share can be updated by getting the latest value from the stock exchange. Even in the case of assets that are not as actively traded as public shares, any recent sale of the same, or a similar asset, will indicate what the current market value of the asset is.
  In the case of very illiquid assets, there is a real difficulty. This, I believe, is where the exposure to risks mentioned earlier is the highest. In such cases, an authorized professional asset valuer will be needed to value the assets. I am not really an expert at valuing such illiquid assets, however, such assets must be valued such that the valuer is able to explain to an auditor why such and such a value was set. If a reasonable basis cannot be determined, the asset shall remain at its original cost.
  Just like no one should be able to reward themselves, likewise, no one should be able to value their own assets. This applies to authorized professional valuers as well. The reason behind this—to deal with the significant threat to objectivity, can be understood quite intuitively. This is likely to help us avoid the problems associated with behavioral biases like “Endowment Bias”—ascribing more value to assets already owned, and “Anchoring Bias”—clinging to arbitrary price levels.
