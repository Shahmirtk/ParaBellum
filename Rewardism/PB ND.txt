Chapter 3: Capitalism

* The Cons *

Capitalism has been studied, analyzed and evaluated quite thoroughly  by professionals and enthusiasts. I do not believe I can highlight the problems associated with Capitalism anywhere near as good as critics like Karl Marx, Adam Smith, etc., did. However, to highlight the significance of the need for a better economic system and the challenges to be overcome by the newer system, if it is to be considered better than Capitalism, I believe it should prove beneficial to have another look at what we are facing.
