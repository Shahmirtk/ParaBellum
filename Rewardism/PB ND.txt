Chapter 3: Capitalism

* The Cons *

A profitable business is not necessarily an ethical or sustainable business. Just because a business yields high profits does not mean it is good for us. It can be damaging the environment we live in or our well-being, making it unsustainable and harmful to us. Investors naturally tend to invest in ideas that yeild high profits. Profits is their primary concern, anything else is secondary. The simple fact that the interests of the "ruling class" and the general public are not aligned is definitely a challenge to be overcome.

Where capital is invested, what is being consumed and the rate of consumption would not be points of concern if the key players were "enlightened" beings. It is the corrupting nature of wealth, and power in general, that makes it almost impossible to become and remain "enlightened". We cannot just blame the providers of harmful products or services because their profits depend on consumers' consumption and so, people can influence investors' decisions by demanding more useful products and services.

"For example, it is not the widespread prevalence of alehouses that causes people to drink to excess. Rather, it is the disposition to drink that gives employment to the alehouses." - The Condensed Wealth of Nations, Page 41

Money or cash has some significant flaws which can, and have been, exploited. Money can easily be transferred, it can be stolen, its source can prove difficult to trace and it can be hidden. This means that those with an excessive quantity of wealth can influence decision-making. They can simply transfer a part of their wealth to the officials involved in decision-making; those officials can then hide the money or its source and get away with it. Let us not forget that both parties are simply acting in their self-interest.

The officials are not the only ones affected, anyone who needs money for whatever reason can be influenced if the price is right. This can lead people to do deeds which they do not like but they think they need to if they are to survive or fulfill their goals. In extreme cases, it can also lead to some horrible crimes. After all, "dirty money" is a word in dictionary for a reason. Would people really end up making the same decisions if money was not a factor?

Cash is meant to make transactions more feasible, which means that it flows through many different hands normally; this exacerbates the problem of germs spreading, which can be a real nuisance in a pandemic. Although modern technology has helped reduce the use of cash by replacing it with electronic payments, cash-based transactions for day-to-day needs, especially in smaller businesses, has not helped in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Politicians and organizations in power can demand "their cut" of the profits of local businesses. Businesses who dare oppose them have to face horrible consequences, unless the investors are powerful enough themselves. Blackmail and theft obviously adversely affect economy because investors are normally risk-averse and also because the profits that could have been reinvested or paid to employees end up in pockets of people who might not be concerned with development. Transferability makes it easier to "set up a gang".

"The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country. He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease. By removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in the country which he left." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book V

Even without the threat of theft or blackmail, investors can transfer their wealth to some other point in the world where the returns are similar or higher and the taxes are lower. This is not just the downside of transferability, but also of taxation. Not only the rate of tax but the rules can affect economy adversely. I mentioned 'kafkaesqueness' earlier, without doubt, the complexity of a system can be the source of real problems such as discouraging compliance.

A system which makes compliance difficult and the fines for non-compliance high really makes life difficult. Not only can it lead to exploitation and frustration, it can also cause tax evasion and the concealment of wealth. When people do not see the results of the wealth collected from them and realize how well the public officers pay themselves, it really discourages them from sharing their wealth with the government. If it invites fraud, it is flawed.

"There is no art which one government sooner learns of another than that of draining money from the pockets of the people." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book V

Adam Smith did not only warn us to be skeptical about the policies suggested by the businessmen, he also highlighted how kings and ministers are the greatest spendthrifts in the society. The investors naturally want to keep the competition, taxes and wages minimized. On the other hand, government officials want to be paid handsomely, so they want to maximize wages and taxes. The general public want lower tax rates, higher wages and higher competition. Clearly, interests of investors, officials and the general public are misaligned.

"The interest of [businessmen] is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ... ought never to be adopted, till after having been long and carefully examined ... with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men ... who have generally an interest to deceive and even oppress the public" - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book I

"It is the highest impertinence and presumption… in kings and ministers, to pretend to watch over the economy of private people, and to restrain their expense... They are themselves always, and without any exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society. Let them look well after their own expense, and they may safely trust private people with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the state, that of their subjects never will." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book II

The luxuries of life, especially the rarest of all, are not necessarily available to those who deserve them the most, but to those who can afford them or have inherited them. In other words, if you can afford it, you can purchase it. It is possible for a person to accumulate a lot of wealth by lots of insignificant transactions; it is also possible for a person to not be well off even after doing significant things in life. It seems unfair that the former should enjoy the luxuries of life which the latter deserves more, especially if the former is a criminal.

"No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book I

The lack of a base standard of living is a flaw of Capitalism for multiple reasons. It can be argued that the most significant resource that we ought to take care of is the human resource. After all, why are we putting in all this effort to come up with a perfect system, if not for our own peace and prosperity? All suffering avoidable by better management of resources clearly indicates the failure of Capitalism. According to The Hunger Virus 2.0 report by Oxfam, 11 people are likely dying every minute from acute hunger - need I say more?

Without access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, education, security, etc., people who can be polished enough to become researchers, doctors, scientists, developers, etc., are dying without being able to contribute to our evolution - contributions which could help deal with currently incurable diseases, climate change, wars, corruption, etc. Kurzgesagt uploaded a video on Egoistic Altruism, which explains how the advancement of others is beneficial to our own selves.
