Why Rewardism?

Purpose of economic system:
# The total wealth/resources of the world are finite and no man can increase that really. The task of the economist is then to utilize and spread these resources and this wealth in the best possible way.
# "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer." {on the significance of giving preference to consumers over producers}
