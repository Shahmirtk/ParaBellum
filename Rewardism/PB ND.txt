Chapter 3: The Capitalist Approach

* The Pros *

"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book I

Capitalism is a very practical system, in the sense that it does not require us to be saints or intellectuals; as Adam Smith explains, it works not because of our humanity but our self-love. The laws of supply and demand are evidence of the market being self-regulating. It is because of this nature of the market and humans' tendency to earn a profit that resources are drawn to their most valued application, i.e., wherever there is a demand, there is a possibility to earn a profit and so, resources are optimally utilized for fulfilling demands.

Uneconomic usage of resources and efforts for low-demand products are naturally unsustainable in Capitalism because people enjoy profits but do not bear losses for long. This means that naturally, resources are utilized by those who can best utilize them for fulfilling the highest demand. This obviously depends on a lot of factors like buying-power, peace, sustainability of what is being demanded, etc. At least in theory, uneconomic activities cannot survive for long in a Capitalist society. 

"In general, if any branch of trade, or any division of labour, be advantageous to the public, the freer and more general the competition, it will always be the more so." - Adam Smith, The Wealth Of Nations, Book II

"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer." - Adam Smith, The Wealth Of Nations, Book IV

Capitalism works best when the level of competition is high. Competition is high when more and more people have access to capital, knowledge and experience. Reducing trade restrictions, facilitating entry into a profession, providing free education and making capital more accessible are likely to increase the level of competition in the market. Not just between employers but also employees and owners. This competition acts as the grease that improves the efficiency of the machine "invisible hand". The efforts of politicians and businesspeople to diminish competition and freedom should therefore be resisted.

Is it not obvious that in a highly competitive market, prices will be low? Goods, services and labor will become cheaper because of abundance and our natural tendency to give a better deal than our competitors. Where production becomes uneconomic, it quickly ceases to exist because it is exceedingly difficult for it to survive in a more competitive market than a non-competitive one. In a non-competitive market, inefficient production can be compensated by setting higher prices but this is not feasible in a more competitive market.

This need for higher competition naturally promotes better education and more liberty for everyone. The wealthy employers benefit from abundance of labor because this means lower cost of labor. So, this means they naturally promote the advancement of people so that they can provide better goods and services while also increasing their profits. The wealthy get wealthier and the common people become more skilled. This natural increase in knowledge and expertise can be argued to be our evolution.

The competitive and brutal but rewarding environment set in a capitalist society is quite ideal for our evolution. This is because it pushes us to our limits, not just to survive but to win and prove ourselves better than our competitors. The suffering of being penniless and the pleasure of being able to buy whatever we want are both effective factors for making us put in the maximum possible effort. To run a successful business we have to find the right problems to solve and the right way to solve them. This way, our problem solving skills are enhanced.

Companies who keep using and improving latest technologies are normally the ones who have the competitive edge. To keep up with the competition, competitors have to come up with at least similar or preferably better technology; otherwise, they suffer from lower rates of profit or even losses and become unsustainable. So we can say, in a way Capitalism is responsible for the rapid advancement in science and technology. Without the profit incentive and death threat, it seems unlikely that such rapid growth is possible.

"When the crown lands had become private property, they would, in the course of a few years, become well-improved and well-cultivated...the revenue which the crown derives from the duties of customs and excise, would necessarily increase with the revenue and consumption of the people." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book V

It can be argued that people perform tasks better when their performance directly affects their own well-being. Companies who take better care of customers' needs generate more wealth than their competitors because customers are more willing to pay them than their competitors. So, we can argue that companies have to perform at a certain level in order to compete with their competitors; which means that our needs are more likely to be better taken care of in Capitalism by private for-profit companies than non-profit organizations.

Without the fear of losing customers and bankruptcy, leaders might not perform at the level they would if they did have this fear. With a proper justice system and a medium for voicing our suggestions, companies who depend on us for their profits perform the best they can to fulfill our desires to maintain a decent reputation. Without a certain level of competition, it seems unlikely that we would have these benefits.

"It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book  V

With the accumulation of wealth, comes the need for security, law and order and a proper justice system. Since the ruling class directly benefits from a carefully designed justice system, it can be argued that they will use their means to make sure it works to safeguard their wealth. Indeed, they are expected to contribute more to the public purse because they benefit more and can afford to contribute more. So, Capitalism promotes justice and forces people to abide by the laws. When law and order is maintained, people can focus on improving their condition without having to worry about injustices.

"Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all." - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book  V

When war is financed through taxes, rather than loans, private capitals suffer greatly and if progressive taxation is implemented, the wealthy ones or the ruling class suffer the most. Therefore, true capitalists desire to get the war financed through loans or to put an end to the war. So in a way, Capitalism opposes war and promotes safety and security of people who are potential customers, shareholders or employees. This is especially true for multinational organizations, who are arguably powerful enough to end wars together, if not alone.

In a Capitalist society, employees are paid according to the work they do. This means that slavery cannot really exist there. Slaves have to be forced to work; this is primarily because they do not expect any reward for the efforts they put in. Even if it seems cheap, it is the least cost-effective sort of labor. People are more likely to perform better if they see any point in doing so, for example, some bonus, some share in the profits, etc. Therefore, we can conclude that Capitalism opposes slavery and promotes rewarding efforts appropriately.

For the sake of argument, let us assume that all the countries of the world are actually cities of one big country. Then, there is no international trade, because there is only one nation. So, the preoccupation with international trade makes no sense. Is it not true that if a country is producing more than it consumes, it is saving and adding to its capital? Is it not wasteful to produce in one geographical area that which can be bought cheaper from another? Capitalism opposes trade restrictions and promotes free market internationally to maximize economy.

Countries who raise trade barriers against others deny themselves the benefits of competition in the international market. When they try to be self-sufficient, they deny themselves the fruits of mastery already achieved by different countries in different products. By trying to master something that has already been mastered, they effectively reinvent the wheel. Although, more countries mastering a field means more competition, it is unnecessary after a reasonable level of competition. Is it not better to master that which has not been mastered yet? So, Capitalism promotes diversity in mastery.

It follows naturally that the advancement of other nations aids the advancement of each nation. A country who imports and exports to developed countries is likely to benefit from more advanced technology and the quality of products and services is generally going to be high. The interests of commerce have often made it necessary to post ambassadors to foreign countries. Keeping all of the above points in mind, we can reliably assume that Capitalism promotes international trade and opposes war and barriers.

"Future income depends on the extent of our capital, and the only way to accumulate capital is by saving. Indeed, just to maintain capital we need to save, because materials and equipment must be repaired and replaced all the time. If instead of saving, we consume our current revenues on unproductive hands, then we are eating into our capital for the purpose of current consumption. This is prodigality, and if it persists, must lead to ruin." - Condensed Wealth of Nations, Page 36

Capitalism punishes misuse of capital and irresponsible consumption. Those who have excessive wealth can afford extravagance but their extravagance is what improves the condition of their suppliers. Their suppliers may not necessarily be wealthy. So, capital flows from unproductive hands to productive hands. When people who cannot afford irresponsible consumption do not manage their expenses, they generally end up under debt or in much darker corners of life. So, it can be argued that Capitalism promotes responsible management of resources, especially capital.

To summarize, the pros of Capitalism are:

  - Practicality: it works because it relies on our self-interest rather than our benevolence and because the market is naturally self-regulating.
  - Punishes wastage of resources: those who best utilize resources to meet the highest demand are the ones who benefit the most, others fail to compete with them.
  - Promotes competition and liberty: a free market and
