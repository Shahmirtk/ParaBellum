Automation
To automate is to reduce human involvement. To reduce human involvment is to make the human element a smaller part of the pie. A truly automated system is impossible because such a system does not exist for us yet and for it to exist, we humans have to develop and start it. Although, once the system is ready, at least in theory, there can be a system that decides the worth of things, the best possible use of them and also puts resource to use accordingly; so, the humans are just left to enjoy the fruits of the automated system. For now, I would like to focus on what can be practically automated.



Risk II: Compatability Risk
Even if we had the best humans who were very concerned about the functioning of the economic system, what good can they do if they do not have the authority to act? What if the government in place does not allow them to act the way they intend to?
