Chapter 3: Capitalism

* The Cons *

A profitable business is not necessarily an ethical or sustainable business. Just because a business yields high profits does not mean it is good for us. It can be damaging the environment we live in and our well-being, making it unsustainable and harmful to us. Investors naturally tend to invest in ideas that yeild high profits. Profits is their primary concern, anything else is secondary. The simple fact that the interests of the "ruling class" and the general public are not aligned is definitely a challenge to be overcome.

"The interest of [businessmen] is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ... ought never to be adopted, till after having been long and carefully examined ... with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men ... who have generally an interest to deceive and even oppress the public" - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book 1

Where capital is invested, what is being consumed and the rate of consumption would not be points of concern if the key players were "enlightened" beings. It is the corrupting nature of wealth, and power in general, that makes it almost impossible to become and remain "enlightened". We cannot just blame the providers of harmful products or services because their profits depend on consumers' consumption and they would have to shift their attention to more beneficial production if people avoid harmful consumption.
