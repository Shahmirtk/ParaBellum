Chapter 4: Rewardism

* The System *

To help you understand what exactly is Rewardism, I want to give you an idea of what life would be like under Rewardism. This might answer a lot of your questions like, "Will I be able to own property?", "Will I have to pay my employees?", "Will there be taxes?", "What if I don't work at all?", "How does one become wealthier?", etc. Instead of answering these questions one by one, perhaps it is more practical to look into what life would be like as an employee, public official, employer, a self-employed person and an unemployed person. 

Employee

Your mother makes an emergency call to the nearest hospital as she's about to have her baby. The ambulance arrives in no time and 2 ladies help her board the vehicle. Upon reaching the hospital, she is rushed to the delivery room. You are born. After your mother has rested, they find out that she doesn't have an ID card because she forgot it in all the hassle. "No matter," says the nurse, comforting your mother. They use her fingerprints and her ID number to record the activity of delivery.

Your details are entered and an account for you is made in the international registery.
