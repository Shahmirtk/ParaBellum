Unemployed:

#You don't do any job or run a business or work in the public but you spend most of your time researching and surviving on whatever you get from your NPs. You find yourself mostly surrounded by educational material, research work, intellectuals and your thoughts. At times you don't even know if it's day or night while working on your favourite research work. You look into the history of economic development, looking into the works of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Hume, Locke and others.



#You write on how we got from the most primitive ways to the current advanced system. You give the most accurate account of the sufferings and exploits of the past and how far humans have made progress. You explain how exactly we shifted from the previous systems to the current one and why it matters. You try to find ways to further optimize the economic system in order to make life more fun and exciting. *Insert quotes to support things you might want to support at this point.
