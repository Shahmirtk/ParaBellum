Chapter 4: Rewardism

* The System *

To help you understand what exactly is Rewardism, I want to give you an idea of what life would be like under Rewardism. This might answer a lot of your questions like, "Will I be able to own property?", "Will I have to pay my employees?", "Will there be taxes?", "What if I don't work at all?", "How does one become wealthier?", etc. Instead of answering these questions one by one, perhaps it is more practical to look into what life would be like as an employee, public official, employer, a self-employed person and an unemployed person. 

Employee

Your mother makes an emergency call to the nearest hospital as she's about to have her baby. The ambulance arrives in no time and 2 ladies help her board the vehicle. Upon reaching the hospital, she is rushed to the delivery room. You are born. After your mother has rested, they find out that she doesn't have an ID card because she forgot it in all the hassle. "No matter," says the nurse, comforting your mother. She uses your mother's fingerprints and ID number to record the activity of delivery.

Your details are entered and an account for you is made in the international registery. Your new "Necessities Points" Card is delivered to your mother. Before leaving the hospital, your mother uses your new NP Card to buy the necessities for you, these include medicines, diapers, food, etc. The points get burned out of your account and the activity is recorded in both your and the pharmacy's account. Your account is linked to your guardian, in this case your mother, until you become an adult.

At the start of each year, you receive more NPs than usual. Your mother uses these extra points to buy a little baby cart for you. Again, the activity is recorded in both the relevant accounts and the points are burned away from your account. Until you turn 7, you live in the same house, same room with your mother. She remains unemployed for the whole duration. Public officials make surprise visits occasionally to see how well your mother is treating you, according to which she receives some "Reward Points".

When you turn 7, you and your mother move to a house with 2 rooms near a school. You are enrolled there and your mother starts teaching too. For enrollment, your ID card and fingerprints are used, your mother's consent is taken too. Any necessities such as books and stationary are provided by the school. Your mother then views your performance in "The App" along with the rest of your activity. After each semester, you rate the performance of your teachers. They receive RPs according to their performance.
