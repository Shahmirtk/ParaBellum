Chapter 4: Rewardism

* The System *

You probably have a lot of questions like, "Will I be able to own property?", "Will I have to pay my employees?", "Will there be taxes?", "What if I don't work at all?", "How does one become wealthier?", etc. Instead of answering these questions one by one, perhaps it is more practical to give you an idea of what life would be like for an employee, public official, employer, a self-employed person and an unemployed person under Rewardism.

Employee

Your mother makes an emergency call to the nearest hospital as she's in labor. The ambulance arrives in no time and 2 ladies help her board the vehicle. Upon reaching the hospital, she is rushed to the delivery room. You are born. After your mother has rested, they find out that she doesn't have an ID card because she forgot it in all the hassle. "No matter," says the nurse, comforting your mother. She uses your mother's fingerprints and ID number to record the activity "delivery".

Your details are entered and an account for you is made in the international registery. Your new "Necessities Points" Card is delivered to your mother. Before leaving the hospital, your mother uses your new NP Card to buy the necessities, which include medicines, diapers, food, water, etc., for you. The points get burned out of your account and the activity is recorded in both your and the pharmacy's account. Your account is linked to your guardian, in this case your mother, until you become an adult.

At each of your birthday, you receive more NPs than usual. Your mother uses these extra points to buy a little baby cart for you. Again, the activity is recorded in both the relevant accounts and the points are burned away from your account. Until you turn 7, you live in the same house, same room with your mother. She remains unemployed for the whole duration. Public officials make surprise visits occasionally to see how well your mother is treating you, according to which she receives some "Reward Points".

When you turn 7, you and your mother move to a house with 2 rooms near a school. You enroll there and your mother starts teaching too. For enrollment, your ID card and fingerprints are used, your mother's consent is taken too. Any necessities such as books and stationary are provided by the school. Your mother then views your performance, along with the rest of your activity, in "The App". After each semester, you rate the performance of your teachers. They receive RPs according to their performance.

According to your performance and behavior, you are given a few RPs to keep you motivated. You decide to save some of them until you become an adult so that you can afford exploring, comfortably, your favorite parts of the world. Over the years you use your IDC, and sometimes fingerprint too, for travelling, communicating, cleaning and other free necessitie, your NPs for limited necessities and your RPs for luxuries such as toys, hotels, cinemas, etc. And so, life goes on. You experience, you learn and grow.

When you turn 16, your performance and interests over the year, along with the predicted future needs, are taken into account to help you decide your major. Until you turn 18, you prepare for examinations and interviews which will decide if you are a good fit. It turns out that you fail the interviews. You are asked to take a leap year or choose a different major. You take a leap year and ace the interviews on your second try. You choose your favorite professors and the interviewer records the activity using your IDC and fingerprints.

Just like in school, your and your professors' performance is recorded semiannually, RPs are given accordingly and necessities are available for free or for NPs. When you graduate, you have no burden of student loan. Talent managers help you utilize your talents and time to solve problems, fulfill demands, earn RPs and possibly a "Higher Status", according to your performance and other factors like supply and demand. "What higher status?," you ask. "Well, it is a way of respecting the noble minds," they reply.

"You see, not everything can be bought using RPs. Some exclusive rewards are for those who solve, or can solve, the biggest problems, who are too valuable to live among the ordinary and who have special needs. In other words, "Higher Beings" are given a "Higher Status" to highlight, protect and facilitate them," explains the senior manager. You look for the biggest problems to be solved and the ways to minimize suffering. You inform a talent manager that you would like to work alongside further studies.

At age 25, equipped with some experience and a lot of knowledge, you set out into the world to help and to benefit.
