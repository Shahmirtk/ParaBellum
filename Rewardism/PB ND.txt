Chapter 3: Capitalism

* The Cons *

A profitable business is not necessarily an ethical or sustainable business. Just because a business yields high profits does not mean it is good for us. It can be damaging the environment we live in and our well-being, making it unsustainable and harmful to us. Investors naturally tend to invest in ideas that yeild high profits. Profits is their primary concern, anything else is secondary. The simple fact that the interests of the "ruling class" and the general public are not aligned is definitely a challenge to be overcome.

Where capital is invested, what is being consumed and the rate of consumption would not be points of concern if the key players were "enlightened" beings. It is the corrupting nature of wealth, and power in general, that makes it almost impossible to become and remain "enlightened". We cannot just blame the providers of harmful products or services because their profits depend on consumers' consumption and so, people can influence investors' decisions by demanding more useful products and services.

"For example, it is not the widespread prevalence of alehouses that causes people to drink to excess. Rather, it is the disposition to drink that gives employment to the alehouses." - The Condensed Wealth of Nations, Page 41

Money or cash has some significant flaws which can, and have been, exploited. Money can easily be transferred, it can be stolen, its source can prove difficult to trace and it can be hidden. This means that those with an excessive quantity of wealth can influence decision-making. They can simply transfer a part of their wealth to the officials involved in decision-making; those officials can then hide the money or its source and get away with it. Let us not forget that both parties are simply acting for their self-interest.

The officials are not the only ones affected, anyone who needs money for whatever reason can be influenced if the price is right. This can lead people to do deeds which they do not like to do but they think they need to do them if they are to survive or fulfill their goals. In extreme cases, it can also lead to some horrible crimes. There is a reason why "blood money" is an actual word in dictionary. Would people really end up making the same decisions if money was not a factor?

Politicians and organizations in power can demand their "cut" of the profits of local businesses. Businesses who dare to oppose them have to be ready for consequences.
