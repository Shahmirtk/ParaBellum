Self-employed:

You just gotta get yourself registered as if you were a company and you'd get some budget for whatever your expenses are, if you're approved that is. You won't really get RPs burned right into your account, but just like in the case of companies, you will get them later on the basis of things like reward factor, activity level, etc. So, it's really simple, you provide services, they burn their RPs for the services they receive and review you. You later get RPs accordingly.

Anyone can register complaints against you or take legal action considering the duties you had to them like due diligence, confidentiality, etc. Your rank/designation improves with time just like if you were a employee. So, it's more or less as if you were a mixture of a corporate entity and an employee. Employees might want to stay employees because of the permanent position they hold in a specific company or because of incentives like EOS and job security etc. Self-employed people might want to enjoy higher freedom and possibly higher earnings on the basis of thier level of activity. They are ready to take the risks of lack of any job security.

Unemployed:

You don't do any job or run a business or work in the public but you spend most of your time researching and surviving on whatever you get from your NPs. You find yourself mostly surrounded by educational material, research work, intellectuals and your thoughts. At times you don't even know if it's day or night while working on your favourite research work. You look into the history of economic development, looking into the works of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Hume, Locke and others.

You write on how we got from the most primitive ways to the current advanced system. You give the most accurate account of the sufferings and exploits of the past and how far humans have made progress. You explain how exactly we shifted from the previous systems to the current one and why it matters. You try to find ways to further optimize the economic system in order to make life more fun and exciting. *Insert quotes to support things you might want to support at this point.
