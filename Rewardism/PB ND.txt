Rewardism, like other man-made systems, is not necessarily free of flaws. There might be some factors that I have failed to account for. There are risks associated with this system. By risks I mean the possibilities of undesirable outcomes once the system has been deployed. To achieve the optimal results, we have to mitigate these risks. The following approach seems reasonable: first, highlight a risk and explain why it is a point of concern; then, suggest control procedures to mitigate the risk. Proactively dealing with the risks is likely to make the implementation phase smoother.

If you recall the purpose of an economic system, which is explained in the introduction, an ideal economic system should utilize all the available resources in the most optimal way. The biggest, and really the only one, risk is the unoptimal utilization of resources. However, this is a very vague and broad challenge to overcome. It makes sense then, to break it down into smaller, more specific, problems to solve. Lack of reliable information, lack of automation, incompetence, unethical decision-making and conflict of interest are the main points of concern.

Risk 1: Lack of reliable information
  Without information, all the managers are essentially blind.
