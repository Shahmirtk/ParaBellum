Chapter 4: Rewardism

* The System *

\people should be able to request what they need (from those responsible for their area/region) and log complaints against their district heads if their needs are not being taken care of (there can be a dedicated site for complaints regarding resources)\;

* = Accounted for, more or less.
? = Is this even relevant to Economics?

Pros: (Communism: -, Capitalism: !) 

- Help people avoid materialistic pursuits and focus on evolution in a more philosophical sense. ?
- Allow people to have enough free time to think, experiment and bring advancement. ?
- Bring about a purity of will. ?

Cons:

- A violent shift from the old ways to the new ones: consent of the affected parties should be taken to get their support.
- Opposition from those in power: accounting for the self-interest of those in power will make a system more likely to be established, simply because they will support it.
- Emotional and illogical thinking: objective and logical thinking will help us establish a better system through avoiding falsehoods and unnecessary exaggerations.
- Giving anyone unfettered power: to avoid the unreasonable exploitation of resources, including human resource, by any being, the new system must balance power distribution. However, I realize that this is more a matter of politics than economics. ?

! Enlightenment being difficult to achieve and maintain: many factors such as demands, undue influence, dependence, etc., make it almost impossible to become and remain enlightened. ?

Points to consider when writing:
- “What can be added to the happiness of a man who is in health, out of debt, and has a clear conscience?”
! * The total wealth/resources of the world are finite and no man can increase that really. The task of the economist is then to utilize and spread these resources and this wealth in the best possible way.
! Money is a utensil, just like pots and pans.
! The fact that wealth and money are separate things can be shown quite easily. After all, a person who receives a guinea of income today may spend that same guinea tomorrow, thus providing the income of a second; and that person may spend the same guinea on the next day, providing the income of a third. So, the amount of money in circulation is clearly much less than the total income of the nation. National income is the quantity of goods bought and sold, not the metal pieces that happen to be used to facilitate the exchange of that product. {highlight significance of activity over money} 
! {link these points to the basis on which people should be rewarded} The non-pecuniary costs and benefits of different industries: 
  ->	Some professions may be easier, cleaner, or more respectable than others.
  ->	Some professions are difficult or expensive to learn. 
  ->	Some trades are seasonal. 
  ->	Earnings are higher in trades that require a large degree of trust (doctors, lawyers, etc.). 
  ->	Earnings reflect the probability of success in any profession (rarity and beauty of talents in professions like acting, singing, etc.).  
 ! People respect authority, strength, wisdom, prudence, maturity, age and wealth. {basis for respectable position holders' selection} 
 ! “The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or less the necessity of application in the teachers Their subsistence [is] altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions” {on the significance of performance-based rewards} 
 ! “The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.” {on the significance of liberty and non-interference} # Explain how it is possible to directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society
 ! The first remedy for self-neglect and profligacy is the study of science and philosophy. The second is to amuse and divert people by promoting the arts. {on the significance of art, science and philosophy} # Explain how to deal with very high buying power and demand.
 ! “Public services are never better performed than when their reward comes in consequence of their being performed, and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them.”
! "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer." {on the significance of giving preference to consumers over producers}
! "Labour remains the real price: money prices are just nominal prices. We buy in from others things that it would cost us more toil and trouble to do for ourselves. The real wealth that we obtain from exchanging with others is their labor, not their money." {use this quote for promoting the idea that money is not important but people and their activities so if we can promote good activities using reward-based system it would be better than people doing weird stuff to get money}  
! So capital is being transferred from people who have a keen interest in using it productively to those, mere creditors, who have no interest in the condition of land or the good management of the capital stock at all. <On the significance of erasing debt.> 
-“How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” - The Theory of Moral Sentiments
! “... and it has, I am afraid, been too common for vessels to fit out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty.” <this is particularly relevant to setting the reward appropriately>
! "A man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants." {on the significance of doing your work yourself}

Answers to possible Questions:
Q: Suppose there's a substance X, which is without doubt harmful, and there is a high demand for this substance for hedonistic reasons; obviously, investors will be attracted to meet this demand to increase their wealth. Under Rewardism, if the company gets high rating from consumers and helps burn a significant amount of RP, then wouldn't they benefit from others' demise just like in the older system? 
A: Well, yes and no. They will benefit but the rewarding factor for such a substance would be lower than other more useful substances. This would deter people from investing time and effort for providing a harmful product. We value non-interference so we cannot ban the production of such a substance as long as it is consensual and does not harm the environment. People will still have the freedom to produce and consume what they like but the government will help deter the consumption of harmful products and services.
