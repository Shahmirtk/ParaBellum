Chapter 4: Rewardism

* The System *

1st - Give an idea of a system without transferrable cash: basic needs of everyone be fulfilled by the system and reward points be given for “extra-effort”, for being a great contributor to the society or for simply being a nice person; such non-transferable/non-tradeable points can only be given by a computer using a formula, the amount being in accordance with the importance of the work done; people should be able to request what they need (from those responsible for their area/region) and log complaints against their district heads if their needs are not being taken care of (there can be a dedicated site for complaints regarding resources); in order to buy some luxury, the user has to “burn” the necessary amount for the transaction rather than transferring it to the luxury-provider; the accounts will be linked to each user's Government-provided-ID and with biometric or some other stronger verification; each reward point's source clearly kept record of in a properly managed database so that the source of all reward points is easily traceable; although transactions will remain private for privacy concerns, however, each transaction can be traced by government officials if needed; the behavior and performance of individuals be monitored and recorded in the database and they be rewarded accordingly; the basis of provision of luxury/rewards should not just be how much reward points one has but also how they earned those points; 

Pros: (Communism: -, Capitalism: !)

- Focus on bringing about real change all the time, rather than just being caught up in theorizing.
- Prefer simplicity over complexity; avoid "Kafkaesqueness".
- Value human resource and focus on the development of everyone, including the poor ones.
- Deal with class antagonism so as to deal with the risk of major disturbance and revolt.
- Value freedom and individualism; get rid of "chains" and enable "wings".
- Deal with the corrupting nature of property and the power it brings.
- Help people avoid materialistic pursuits and focus on evolution in a more philosophical sense.
- Free people from the concerns of survival and enable them to think at a "higher level".
- Allow people to have enough free time to think, experiment and bring advancement.
- Promote automation and advancement of technology; for this, it should ensure people are not dependent on any job.
- Promote people to gain the "luminous summits" of science and philosophy in general.
- Bring about a purity of will.

! Capitalism being practical: it works because it relies on our self-interest rather than our benevolence and because the market is naturally self-regulating.
! Wastage of resources being punished: those who best utilize resources to meet the highest demand are the ones who benefit the most, others fail to compete with them.
! Competition and liberty being promoted: consumers benefit from higher quality and lower prices when competition and liberty is higher; this pushes us to think more open-mindedly and become more competent, evolving us in the process.
! Advancement of science and technology being promoted: companies equipped with better technology can get tasks done more efficiently which gives them a competitive edge over others.
! Better user experience being promoted: customer satisfaction becomes a matter of life and death for companies in a competitive environment, which allows customers to voice their concerns and get the best possible treatment.
! Law and order being promoted: without the aid of the Civil Magistrate, owners of property run the risk of losing their property. A safe and secure environment is best for traders to trade without fear of injustices.
! Rewarding being promoted and slavery being opposed: employees normally do their best to earn rewards such as bonuses, promotions, etc. Rewarding appropriately encourages better performance and confidence which means higher efficiency.
! Globalization and diversity in mastery being promoted: countries who benefit from cheaper products and specializations of other countries can focus on their own specializations and cut unnecessary costs. Resources are better managed this way as countries avoid reinventing the wheel.

Cons:

- A violent shift from the old ways to the new ones: consent of the affected parties should be taken to get their support.
- Opposition from those in power: accounting for the self-interest of those in power will make a system more likely to be established, simply because they will support it.
- Emotional and illogical thinking: remaining objective means, we value a proper system more than our personal preferences.
- Losing the benefits of the old system: benefits such as motivation and respect given by property, enhanced productivity by specialization, etc., should be accounted for.
- Giving anyone unfettered power: to avoid the unreasonable exploitation of resources, including human resource, by any being, the new system must balance power distribution. However, I realize that this is more a matter of politics than economics.

! Profitability not being equivalent to usefulness: the pursuit of wealth can be damaging to the environment or people affected by the business.
! Enlightenment being difficult to achieve and maintain: many factors such as demands, undue influence, dependence, etc., make it almost impossible to become and remain enlightened.
! Money being transferrable: transferrability of money causes problems like bribe, blackmail, theft, hidden source, transfer of diseases, etc. Key decision-makers being influenced by the "ruling class" is a threat to objective decision-making.
! The interests of investors, public officials and the general public being misaligned: one wants lower taxes but the other's wages depend on those taxes, one wants lower wages but the others depend on those wages.
! The system being very complex: "kafkaesqueness" can lead to problems such as poor understanding of the system, rules being broken and advancement being slowed down. If it invites fraud, it is flawed.
! Rarest luxuries not necessarily being available to the most deserving: rarest of luxuries are only given to those who can afford them; in other words, the source of money is irrelevant as long as the bid is the highest.
! Base standard of living not being set: living beings are suffering because of lack of access to the basic necessities of life. Potential is being wasted. Thinking is limited to survival.
! True freedom not being achieved: dependence on useless or boring jobs and needing to satisfy employers or customers really restrains people.
! Automation being delayed: dependence on jobs that can be automated is delaying advancement of AI and making it a grey area. Each automated job is making the system less stable.

Points to consider when writing:
- “What can be added to the happiness of a man who is in health, out of debt, and has a clear conscience?”
! * The total wealth/resources of the world are finite and no man can increase that really. The task of the economist is then to utilize and spread these resources and this wealth in the best possible way.
! Money is a utensil, just like pots and pans.
! The fact that wealth and money are separate things can be shown quite easily. After all, a person who receives a guinea of income today may spend that same guinea tomorrow, thus providing the income of a second; and that person may spend the same guinea on the next day, providing the income of a third. So, the amount of money in circulation is clearly much less than the total income of the nation. National income is the quantity of goods bought and sold, not the metal pieces that happen to be used to facilitate the exchange of that product. {highlight significance of activity over money} 
! {link these points to the basis on which people should be rewarded} The non-pecuniary costs and benefits of different industries: 
  ->	Some professions may be easier, cleaner, or more respectable than others.
  ->	Some professions are difficult or expensive to learn. 
  ->	Some trades are seasonal. 
  ->	Earnings are higher in trades that require a large degree of trust (doctors, lawyers, etc.). 
  ->	Earnings reflect the probability of success in any profession (rarity and beauty of talents in professions like acting, singing, etc.).  
 ! People respect authority, strength, wisdom, prudence, maturity, age and wealth. {basis for respectable position holders' selection} 
 ! “The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or less the necessity of application in the teachers Their subsistence [is] altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions” {on the significance of performance-based rewards} 
 ! “The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.” {on the significance of liberty and non-interference} # Explain how it is possible to directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society
 ! The first remedy for self-neglect and profligacy is the study of science and philosophy. The second is to amuse and divert people by promoting the arts. {on the significance of art, science and philosophy} # Explain how to deal with very high buying power and demand.
 ! “Public services are never better performed than when their reward comes in consequence of their being performed, and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them.”
! "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer." {on the significance of giving preference to consumers over producers}
! "Labour remains the real price: money prices are just nominal prices. We buy in from others things that it would cost us more toil and trouble to do for ourselves. The real wealth that we obtain from exchanging with others is their labor, not their money." {use this quote for promoting the idea that money is not important but people and their activities so if we can promote good activities using reward-based system it would be better than people doing weird stuff to get money}  
! So capital is being transferred from people who have a keen interest in using it productively to those, mere creditors, who have no interest in the condition of land or the good management of the capital stock at all. <On the significance of erasing debt.> 
-“How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” - The Theory of Moral Sentiments
! “... and it has, I am afraid, been too common for vessels to fit out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty.” <this is particularly relevant to setting the reward appropriately>
! "A man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants." {on the significance of doing your work yourself}

Answers to possible Questions:
! Suppose there's a substance X, which is without doubt harmful, and there is a high demand for this substance for hedonistic reasons; obviously, investors will be attracted to meet this demand to increase their wealth. Under Rewardism, if the company gets high rating from consumers and helps burn a significant amount of RP, then wouldn't they benefit from others' demise just like in the older system? Well, yes and no. They will benefit but the rewarding factor for such a substance would be lower than other more useful substances. This would deter people from investing time and effort for providing a harmful product. We value non-interference so we cannot ban the production of such a substance as long as it is consensual and does not harm the environment. People will still have the freedom to produce and consume what they like but the government will help deter the consumption of harmful products and services.
