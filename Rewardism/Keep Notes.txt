*Root of problems
Ignorance, not money. Ideal Capitalism without ignorance is better than Ideal Communism and Rewardism with ignorance.
Solution to ignorance: valuing objectivity and truth.

*The One Mango Tree
What if there was just one mango tree with limited mangoes. Compare control and distribution in the two systems: Capitalism and Rewardism.
• Capitalism: Controlled by the richest and fiercest. Mangoes sold to the highest bidder.
• Rewardism: Controlled by the wisest and sincerest. Mangoes given to the most deserving.

*Performance measures
For companies with products and/or services available over a huge geographical area, the performance will be measured for a shorter region (a city, two cities, a state, etc.).
There should be a dedicated app for reviews and reports where only customers can review or report companies.
Performance auditors should audit each accounting period to identify any fraud or poor performance.

*Miscellaneous
• Elders' contribution: People with 'enough' free time contributing ideas and their knowledge regarding whatever they specialize in or are interested in. - 'Non-annoying' method used to take benefit of their knowledge and experience to make improvements. (HR)
• Relief System: Account for loneliness problem with the new urges-relief system. - Emotionally connected with only the one committed to, not attached with sex partners (just like not with food) but still enjoy the process (like eating). - Training and Counselling sessions for helping partners in supporting each other (especially in tough times) - Profile of people maintained to indicate status of diseases and 'satisfaction rating' (cleanliness, size, previous sex-partners' reviews regarding 'doing as told' and niceness). 
• "Productivity Enhancement Room" in design of houses for individuals: solitude, silence, inspirational room.
• "Disliked jobs" automated as much as possible so that least amount of people have to do such jobs.
• Reasoning system: - Should take responsibility of research work, including the effects of "pleasure-seeking activities". On the basis of the research done, and the reasoning and the deductions from it, guidance should be provided to the Relief system. - "Big decisions" can only be taken after approval from the leaders of the Reasoning System. The leaders can interfere in other decisions too if they have grounds to believe that the decision is very unreasonable.
