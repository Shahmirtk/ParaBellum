2) Planning
It is quite obvious that just knowing what the change should be is not enough, as we also need to know *how* to bring about that change. For this purpose, a proper plan shall be made which is to consider all possible and significant risks, provide practical solutions to manage them, and guide the executors of the plan. The best planners are those who are aware of the significant risks, and have the expertise to manage them. Risk management includes taking reasonable risks, and not just avoiding them.
It is at this stage that the heads of all the divisions of the WRMO shall be hired. They shall be responsible for the aspects of the planning that relate to their respective division. Successful planning requires the joint efforts of all the key players in the WRMO. Without collaboration, the plan is unlikely to be well-synchronized, meaning that one head might want to lead the executors in one direction, while another head might wish otherwise. So, a “Chief Head” shall be responsible for synchronizing the different aspects of the plan.

The planning documents can be categorized broadly into two main categories: The General Plan; and the Specific Plans.

2A) The General Plan
This document shall mainly be about how the WRMO is to be fully formed and become functional. It is to include details starting from the hiring of talent, and ending at the verification of each product and service being up to standard. This document is to be prepared with a risk-based approach, so it shall highlight the optimal level of risk the WRMO shall take, and include appropriate control procedures for the management of risk.
In the “Q&A” chapter, I wrote that the ideas about repayment of debt shall be found in the “Deployment” chapter, so, let us look into it now. The plan for repaying debt shall be written in the General Plan as this task relates to every Rewardist region. Do you have any relevant practical idea? First, let us try to understand what exactly the problem is. If you really think about it, this is more a matter of human psychology than any other matter.
We do not need to appeal to the *good side* of the lenders, which seems impractical, especially with significantly large debt involved, nor do we need to adopt any violent way, which might defeat the whole purpose of repaying debt. Why go through all that trouble when you can simply reward the lenders for lending their capital? Knowing that an international organization is committed to keeping the RPs stable and valuable, the lenders are highly likely to be satisfied with getting their capital back in the newer and better currency.
What I am suggesting is, if there is reasonable evidence that an entity A is owed 1M USD by entity B, since, initially the USD RP will be pegged to the USD, then the entity A shall be rewarded with 1M USD RPs, which is likely to satisfy entity A, and shall remove the debt obligation from entity B, all without any violence or begging. Really, this process is quite similar to a third party buying an entity’s receivables; the third party being the WRMO. It seems safe to assume that creditors simply want their capital back, and that they do not really care who makes the payment.
The plan has to include ways to manage any related risks. For example, the risk of rejection of RPs due to the fear of devaluation can be managed by promising a compensation for any devaluation in the first five years after the repayment. Furthermore, a bonus of 2% can be paid for accepting the risks associated with a new currency. The benefit to the creditors is clearly more than just the 2%, because the repayment by the WRMO safeguards them other significant risks like credit risk.

2B) The Specific Plans
Each “Specific Plan” shall be specific to its Rewardist region, which shall explain how Rewardism is to be deployed there. Each document shall include details starting from the hiring of workers within the relevant region, and ending at the verification of Rewardism running smoothly within that region. Furthermore, each document shall include appropriate control procedures for controlling the risks associated with deployment.
Laying out the plan in terms of easy-to-understand, achievable, and challenging objectives is likely to make it easier for the executors to follow the plan. The objectives set shall reflect the specific version of Rewardism to be deployed. Deadlines and performance-based rewards for the executors shall be set at the planning stage to motivate them to work dilligently and with high integrity.

3) Development
Following the instructions given in the General Plan, the different products and services to be provided by the WRMO shall be developed for testing purposes. At this stage, a Specific Plan would only be relevant to the extent of the development of products and services specific to the relevant region. In other words, those involved in the development shall have to be aware of the requirements specific to different regions. Being aware of the individual requirements of all the different regions, and acting accordingly, is paramount to the success of Rewardism in every Rewardist region.

4) Examination
Once we have developed the required products and services, we must examine them, one last time, to avoid problems later on. The General Plan, the specific versions of Rewardism, and the plans for deploying them have to be examined too to identify all significant issues, so that they can be resolved. The public is likely to trust Rewardism, and the WRMO, more if they know that significant thoughts and efforts have been put in to examining it. Let us look into an example of an issue, and how to resolve it.

*The Issue*: An individual might incentivise another to claim to owe money to him, to exploit the debt-rewarding scenario. This risk is high among individuals from villages due to a lack of availability of bank statements.
*The Solutions*: The assets of individuals, of value up to the total of the debt claimed to be owed, shall be seized to prevent false claims. Making false claims shall be made a punishable offence. In absence of reliable evidence, further investigation shall be due before debt can be repaid. In case of significant doubt, no RPs shall be given. Record-keeping shall be made compulsory for audits. Whistleblowing shall be facilitated.

5) Execution
How easily Rewardism is effectively deployed, depends on the quality of the documents, the executors, and the overseers. Optimal performance in the previous stages shall add to the efficiency at the Execution stage. The main point of concern at this stage shall be whether *everything goes according to plan*. It seems unlikely that everything shall have been planned for, so the main skill needed for proper execution is the ability to quickly and effectively respond to anomolies.

6) Verification
After the Execution stage, it naturally makes sense to verify whether Rewardism has been properly deployed. The verifiers shall heavily depend on the control procedures set within the relevant documents. These control procedures shall cover a broad range of functions of the new system. Succesful verification shall imply that all the significant functions of Rewardism are live. This stage cannot be marked completed unless all procedures, including getting the public’s approval, are done. Improving Rewardism shall be a continuous process, small issues shall not stop this stage from being marked completed.

7) Endgame
I do not expect all countries to accept Rewardism initially. Some countries might wish to see its effects on other countries first, while those other countries lead the way through uncharted waters. If the deployment of Rewardism in those other countries is verified, and it proves useful to them, then it is natural to expect a demand for Rewardism in other regions. Interestingly, while competition between countries is not unheard of, a new kind of competition shall rise: That between economic systems. Whatever happens, Rewardism can be deemed successful in the Endgame if it becomes the system for the galaxies and the millennia to come.
