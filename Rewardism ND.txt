Chapter 8: Why Rewardism

“If you have your Why? of life, you can put up with just about any How?” - Friedrich Nietzsche

If we understand why we must adopt Rewardism, we can put up with just about any hurdle. However, if no convincing reason is there, we would rather focus on other challenges. As Elon Musk puts it, “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.” The significance of doing something because it is necessary, even if it seems impossible, is also demonstrated in the famous docking scene of Interstellar.

Imagine, if you will, you are sitting in an auditorium and I am on the stage. Look around at the audience. Notice there are two groups: A large group below the stage; And a very small group above it. The small group consists of bald, old, and well-dressed men, sitting on what look like thrones. The larger group consists of people wearing ragged clothes, sitting on the floor. You find yourself in the group relevant to you.

Within the audience are those who want to understand and who care about our evolution, and those who don’t. As for those who don’t, they are irrelevant because no matter how strong are the reasons I give, they will simply not care. Please, listen, understand, and care. You who sit on the floor, I know you care deeply about this change and you need not much convincing. Those who really need convincing are the ones who are already well-off without the change.

Oh you who sit above, know that the combined force of the larger group can be powerful enough to overthrow you. However, let us learn from history and not let the atrocities of the past repeat. You, having the power, can help bring about the change we need. If you are convinced, we shall find it easy to adopt the new system. If you oppose it, well... Let’s just say, there will be complications.

Human nature

“How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” - Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments

I understand that appealing to your virtue is not necessarily enough to convince you, however, this quote seems significant enough to be mentioned here. The significance of this quote is that it helps us realize our true nature. We do not really want to count our pennies every night or “win at all costs.” We want to do good for others, and live on after our death through our contribution to the world. This is indeed a generalization, and there can be exceptions, but we can ignore the exceptions.
Ask yourself: “What do I really want? Is it really just the accumilation of wealth? Or do I want something deeper than that?” Do you not want to connect with the world, your fellow humans, and *truly* live? What does it mean to *truly* live? Can Rewardism not help us get to our ideal world? And can it not help us better than any other economic system? Do you not think this change would be an interesting event in history? And do you not want to help us and be a part of it?
