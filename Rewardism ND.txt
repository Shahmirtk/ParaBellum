Chapter 8: Why Rewardism

“If a man knows the wherefore of his existence, then the manner of it can take care of itself.” — Friedrich Nietzsche, The Twilight of the Idols

If we understand why we must adopt Rewardism, we can put up with just about any hurdle. However, if no convincing reason is there, we would rather focus on other challenges. As Elon Musk puts it, “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.” The significance of doing something because it is necessary, even if it seems impossible, is also demonstrated in the famous docking scene of Interstellar.

Imagine, if you will, you are sitting in an auditorium and I am on the stage. Look around at the audience. Notice there are two groups: A large group below the stage; And a very small group above it. The small group consists of bald, old, and well-dressed men, sitting on what look like thrones. The larger group consists of people wearing ragged clothes, sitting on the floor. You find yourself in the group relevant to you.

Within the audience are those who want to understand and who care about our evolution, and those who don’t. As for those who don’t, they are irrelevant because no matter how strong are the reasons I give, they will simply not care. Please, listen, understand, and care. You who sit on the floor, I know you care deeply about this change and you need not much convincing. Those who really need convincing are the ones who are already well-off without the change.

Oh you who sit above, know that the combined force of the larger group can be powerful enough to overthrow you. However, let us learn from history and not let the atrocities of the past repeat. You, having the power, can help bring about the change we need. If you are convinced, we shall find it easy to adopt the new system. If you oppose it, well... Let’s just say, there will be complications.

*Human Nature*

“How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” — Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments

I understand that appealing to your virtue is not necessarily enough to convince you, however, this quote seems significant enough to be mentioned here. The significance of this quote is that it helps us realize our true nature. Generally, we do not really want to count our pennies every night, or “win at all costs”; rather, we want to do good for others, and live on after our death through our contribution to the world.
Take out some time to meditate and reflect on your true nature. Ask yourself: “What do I really want? Is it really just the accumulation of wealth? Or do I want something deeper than that?” Do you not want to connect with the world, your fellow humans, and *truly* live? What does it mean to *truly* live? Can Rewardism not help us get to our ideal world? And can it not help us better than any other economic system?

*Real Wealth*

"Labour remains the real price: money prices are just nominal prices. We buy in from others things that it would cost us more toil and trouble to do for ourselves. The real wealth that we obtain from exchanging with others is their labor, not their money." — The Condensed Wealth of Nations, Page 15

While this quote helps one realize that money is not necessarily the real wealth, it is at once not specific nor wide enough to fully describe what true wealth is. Yes, not everyone is good at computers or surgery, and indeed, no amount of wealth can make you an expert at any complex task, unless you put in the effort. However, specialization is one of the things money cannot buy. I am sure you can come up with other important things money cannot buy.
I define real wealth simply as “realized potential.” Consider the universe we live in. It is full of opportunities. Everywhere, there is an opportunity to realize potential, in one way or another. But what is potential? And how does one realize it? By potential, I mean that which, if realized, excites consciousness. The higher the potential, the higher the excitation. The higher the excitation, the more we feel alive.
Assume that in a given moment there are two opportunities, A, and B. If the opportunities are such that pursuing one means forgoing the other, then realizing one’s potential means the other’s potential remains permanently unrealized. When evaluating and picking one out of more than one opportunities, the maximum possible permanent unrealized potential is refered to as the opportunity cost.
If you look at the universe in this manner, and every decision as picking one opportunity over another, you are likely to agree with me when I say that the true wealth we obtain in this short life of ours is the potential we realize, and that the true loss is all the unrealized potential that could have been realized. Thinking in this way is likely to help you realize how important it is to update the economic system such that we avoid the greatest loss and obtain the greatest wealth.
*Is the opportunity cost of sticking with Capitalism, instead of updating to Rewardism, not too high? Do you not realize?*

*The Big Forgiveness*

“To err is human, to forgive, divine.” — Alexander Pope, An Essay On Criticism

How have you obtained your property? Do you oppose the update because you fear losing your property? Fear not. No matter what you have done to obtain your property, it is a matter of the past. We look on to the future. All I can say is, if I was in your place, I would have done the same. I believe so because it is fairly evident that we live in a deterministic universe. So, solving problems matter more to me than accusing and punishing.
It is not your fault that you did whatever you did. Had there been a better system in place, a system which focused on the causes and did not allow any wrongdoing, you would not have been able to do anything wrong. We are all together in this. We have failed to update the system, and we have not evolved enough to be perfect within an imperfect system. Let us all realize how much this update means to all of us.
*I do not ask you to confess, nor do I ask you to give up your property. I offer you my hand. Do you not seek salvation?*

*Inheritance*

Before I help you understand why I oppose inheritance, understand that the lack of inheritance is not an essential feature of Rewardism. All the other features of Rewardism can be implemented while still allowing for inheritance. Now, consider a world without the notion of inheritance. Think of the value of property in such a world. How would people perceive the well-off ones? How would your life be different?
Now consider the world where people inherit the properties of their ancestors. Which world better manages resources? Does it not make sense that property should belong to those who have actually earned it, instead of those who are merely born in the *right family*? When you look at someone in a luxury car, do you think of the person as being a valuable contributor to the society, or are their doubts as to the source of the car?
I realize that the cold turkey method might not be appropriate. An abrupt end to inheritance might be too big a change for it to be feasible. That is why I suggest that we start by allowing people to inherit their immediate parents’ wealth, but disallowing any further inheritance. This change is not as big as completely ending inheritance, so, it is more feasible. In the future, when we have evolved enough, there can be an update that completely ends inheritance.
*Patch End-Inheritance will have to wait for now.*

*Capital Gains*

Linked with the authenticity and value of property, the objectivity of officials, and the need for a proper rewarding mechanism is the issue of capital gains. To better understand what the issues at hand are, consider the following fictitious examples:

	*1. John earns his income by doing heart surgery mainly. Sam makes a living exploiting weaknesses in the stock market. While John is saving lives, Sam is buying low and selling high. Arguably, John contributes more to the society than Sam. Yet, Sam earns more than John, simply by benefitting from capital gains. Do you not see what is wrong here?*
	*2. Salman bought a small land and a newly developed house in a developing society in his city an year ago. Now that the society is more developed, the prices there have increased. Without doing any effort, simply by waiting an year, Salman has more than doubled his networth. With the high demand for property in that society, he easily sells the house and locks in his profit. He holds on to the land for further capital appreciation. Do you not see what is wrong here?*
	*3. Eliza, a business owner in India, wants to influence Raj, a powerful government official there. Rewardism has been deployed in India but capital gains were allowed. Raj buys a simple painting for 5,000 INR RPs. Eliza offers to buy the painting for 50M INR RPs. The transaction occurs, Raj earns about 50M INR RPs, and 50M INR RPs are burned away from Eliza’s account. This is recorded as a genuine transaction in both, Raj’s, and Eliza’s acount. Do you not see what is wrong here?*

Is it not tragic how valuable talent has been wasted on meaningless pursuits? If our goal is to realize the maximum potential, which includes evolving to the highest possible point, then it is quite clear that intelligent scientists and mathematicians, like Jim Simons, have been extremely misdirected. Sure, they might have given lectures, and they might have given a lot of charity, however, what if all that talent was directed towards solving more meaningful problems, instead of chasing trends in the market?
It is interesting how such people can benefit from inefficiencies in the market, but fail to realize, or do something about, their own inefficiencies. Recall how I defined real wealth and real loss. How much did such intelligent people truly lose? Did they really earn true wealth? Again, it is not their fault. It is the system that has to be updated. Had capital gains not been a thing, they would have most likely solved much more important problems.
*Once we close all the doors that don’t really matter, we would have no option but to open the one that does.*

*Property*

“The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate, that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security.” — Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations

“Smith’s argument that law and government are institutions devised by the rich to prevent them being robbed by the poor does not mean that it is a bad system. He has already remarked earlier that for people to accumulate capital, they must have confidence that their property, which may take years of effort to acquire, will not be stolen from them. And this capital accumulation is essential for economic growth.” — The Condensed Wealth of Nations, Page 62

Rewardism differs from Communism, and is similar to Capitalism, in that property can be owned, and owners can sleep in security under the shelter of the civil magistrate. In fact, the source of property and other relevant details are to be stored in the account of the owner. Recording the details of transactions and properties will likely help with the swift provision of justice.

*Superintending and Directing*

“The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty, in the attempting to perform which he must always be exposed to innumerable delusions, and for the proper performance of which, no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.” — Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations

Notice that Smith does not really argue against the existence of the interest of the society. When arguing against the superintending and directing of the industry of private people, he assumes the interest of the society is known. Hume’s Guillotine does not allow for any objective ought. However, for the sake of making a decision, let us assume that we have a common goal: realizing the maximum potential.
We can argue that some decisions are better than others for achieving the common goal. Doctors know what good health is, and they can tell an unhealthy lifestyle from a healthy one. They do not really say that there are no right or wrong answers to questions about a healthy lifestyle. Economists should know what a good economy is, and they should be able to tell decisions that are clearly bad for the economy from decisions that are likely to improve the economy.
If we have a common goal, and we can tell bad decisions from good decisions, then what is stopping us from *superintending the industry of private people, and directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society*? In his time, Smith was probably right when he said that *no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient*, but with a newer economic system, and with the assistance of AI, his claim can be easily challenged.
The challenge we must be aware of, which Smith has highlighted, is that of superintending and directing without being delusional. Indeed, we shall *be exposed to innumerable delusions*, and to overcome this challenge, we must find a way to remain objective. For this purpose, I recommend looking at the numbers. You must have heard, “numbers don’t lie.” At this point, going into the details is not convenient. Just know that performance appraisal shall be as objective as possible.

*Debt Repayment*

You might argue that repaying the debt of people is unfair to those without any debt obligation, as it is like giving free RPs to some and not to others. Consider the analogy where you have people who are either healthy (without debt) or unhealthy. Would you really say that treating the unhealthy ones to make them healthy is unfair to the healthy ones? Those who shall receive the RPs for the debt owed to them are just being given what they were owed, so it is justified.

*Company Standards*

The purpose of setting standards is not to make all the companies the same. Standards primarily help with reducing the likelihood of underperformance occurring. Not every company shall have to comply with each relevant standard to stay alive. Only the companies in a very sensitive industry shall be required to meet standards to stay alive. For example, a restuarant shall have to meet a minimum hygiene level to continue its business.

*Against Kafkaesqueness*



*Universal Basic Income*

“But Shahmir, why go through all the trouble of deploying a new system, when we can just set a UBI?” The UBI can be set in NPs, and NPs are a form of UBI, then, it does not seem very intuitive to compare NPs and UBI. The main idea behind setting a UBI is to set a good enough base standard of living. The lack of a good enough base standard of living is just one of the many problems that we have to solve. There are so many aspects of Rewardism that it seems foolish to compare Rewardism with UBI as a solution to those problems.

*A New Game*

The Korean TV show “Squid Games” highlighted an interesting issue: boredom. Perhaps, you too want something interesting to happen. Do you not find it interesting to switch from a millennia old system to an exciting new system? The whole change, the uncertainty, the risks, and the opportunities, do they not excite you? You might have mastered the old world order, let it be now. Challenge yourself. Do you not want to play a new game?

##

Oh you, the intellectuals, I address you now.

*The Ideal Economic System*

Think of the ideal economic system again. How close is Rewardism to it? Rewardism has been, and shall be, designed, in all material aspects, to be like the ideal economic system. Let us now analyze Rewardism in context of the essential features of the ideal economic system.

Recall that under the ideal economic system:

- Causes are prioritized over effects.
Analysis: Rewardism focuses on the causes in two ways: By removing the harmful causes; And by putting in place beneficial causes. Easily and anonymously transferrable money is what allows for money laundering. Rewardism deals with the risk of money laundering by replacing the old form of money with Points, which are impossible to launder. Arguably, the lack of a good enough base standard of living causes many problems in society. For survival, who knows to what extreme men can go. Rewardism solves such problems from their roots.
Beneficial causes put in place include rewarding factors and formulas, Higher Status, etc. Such features are likely to influence the masses, and are put in place to direct us in the *right direction*. Even the name of the system suggests that the whole system is about rewarding efforts which *the wise ones* consider worth rewarding. The Big Forgiveness should convince you that we want to solve problems, not point fingers.

- All resources are *optimally utilized* without any *noise*. Optimal utilization being "the action of making practical and effective use of whatever is being utilized, in a way that is most favorable to *us*." Noise being “that which distracts.”
Analysis: The WRMO, and its Resource Allocation department in particular, shall be dedicated to the optimal utilization of resources by responsible allocation. Depending on the cooperation of governments, with the help of the best talent the world has to offer, and with a deep understanding of the “way that is most favorable to us,” resources are likely to be optimally utilized under Rewardism. User reviews shall be taken very seriously, and therefore, managing the resources without any noise or disturbance shall be a top priority of the WRMO.

- *True freedom* is achieved.
Analysis: We cannot achieve true freedom because it is simply impossible to decide what we want. We simply have our wants. Still, there is a difference between being able to do what you want, and not being able to do what you want. By setting a good enough base standard of living, Rewardism shall free us of the survival mode, and enable us to dream bigger. By freeing us from the drive for accumulating wealth for our decendants, and by eliminating the possibility of capital gains, Rewardism directs us towards other, more meaningful pursuits.
By rewarding lower prices, and by removing the need for profits, Rewardism makes it easier to access products and services. By automating the boring jobs in a sustainable manner, Rewardism allows us to focus on the more creative or *human* tasks, while making the products and services even more accessible. By making us financially independent, Rewardism enables us to stand on our feet, and make our relationships more pure. Despite all the directing, Rewardism leaves the final decision to us, and does not really judge. For Rewardism is beyong Good and Evil.

*True Globalization*

“ Do you look upon yourself as a German or as a Jew?"
“It is quite possible," Einstein replied, “to be both. I look upon myself as a man. Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is
the measles of mankind."

— Excerpt from "What Life Means to Einstein, An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck"

“Can your left hand owe anything to your right hand? Can your body function optimally if some part of it is denied energy or very important nutrients?” To really understand the importance of true globalization, you must consider the whole world and all the conscious beings as a single entity; then, you should understand how the suffering of even the smallest part of it is saddening and wrong; then, you should realize how much the success of others is important for your own success.
To better understand the importance of true globalization, take the most developed country in the world and consider the whole world to be that one country, just with access to more resources. One Org with all the info of economy is better suited to make adjustments. The WRMO shall act as a platform for Economists to control the economy of the world. Why leaders of nations should dopt this system and become one with the international nation: access to resources from around the globe and a better and well-thought-out system with international support and standards.

*Economic Activity*
