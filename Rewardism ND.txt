Chapter 8: Why Rewardism

“If a man knows the wherefore of his existence, then the manner of it can take care of itself.” — Friedrich Nietzsche, The Twilight of the Idols

If we understand why we must adopt Rewardism, we can put up with just about any hurdle. However, if no convincing reason is there, we would rather focus on other challenges. As Elon Musk puts it, “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.” The significance of doing something because it is necessary, even if it seems impossible, is also demonstrated in the famous docking scene of Interstellar.

Imagine, if you will, you are sitting in an auditorium and I am on the stage. Look around at the audience. Notice there are two groups: A large group below the stage; And a very small group above it. The small group consists of bald, old, and well-dressed men, sitting on what look like thrones. The larger group consists of people wearing ragged clothes, sitting on the floor. You find yourself in the group relevant to you.

Within the audience are those who want to understand and who care about our evolution, and those who don’t. As for those who don’t, they are irrelevant because no matter how strong are the reasons I give, they will simply not care. Please, listen, understand, and care. You who sit on the floor, I know you care deeply about this change and you need not much convincing. Those who really need convincing are the ones who are already well-off without the change.

Oh you who sit above, know that the combined force of the larger group can be powerful enough to overthrow you. However, let us learn from history and not let the atrocities of the past repeat. You, having the power, can help bring about the change we need. If you are convinced, we shall find it easy to adopt the new system. If you oppose it, well... Let’s just say, there will be complications.

Human nature

“How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” — Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments

I understand that appealing to your virtue is not necessarily enough to convince you, however, this quote seems significant enough to be mentioned here. The significance of this quote is that it helps us realize our true nature. Generally, we do not really want to count our pennies every night, or “win at all costs”; rather, we want to do good for others, and live on after our death through our contribution to the world.
Take out some time to meditate and reflect on your true nature. Ask yourself: “What do I really want? Is it really just the accumulation of wealth? Or do I want something deeper than that?” Do you not want to connect with the world, your fellow humans, and *truly* live? What does it mean to *truly* live? Can Rewardism not help us get to our ideal world? And can it not help us better than any other economic system?

Real wealth

"Labour remains the real price: money prices are just nominal prices. We buy in from others things that it would cost us more toil and trouble to do for ourselves. The real wealth that we obtain from exchanging with others is their labor, not their money." — The Condensed Wealth of Nations, Page 15

While this quote helps one realize that money is not necessarily the real wealth, it is at once not specific nor wide enough to fully describe what true wealth is. Yes, not everyone is good at computers or surgery, and indeed, no amount of wealth can make you an expert at any complex task, unless you put in the effort. However, specialization is one of the things money cannot buy. I am sure you can come up with other important things money cannot buy.
I define real wealth simply as “realized potential.” Consider the universe we live in. It is full of opportunities. Everywhere, there is an opportunity to realize potential, in one way or another. But what is potential? And how does one realize it? By potential, I mean that which, if realized, excites consciousness. The higher the potential, the higher the excitation. The higher the excitation, the more we feel alive.
Assume that in a given moment there are two opportunities, A, and B. If the opportunities are such that pursuing one means forgoing the other, then realizing one’s potential means the other’s potential remains permanently unrealized. When evaluating and picking one out of more than one opportunities, the maximum possible permanent unrealized potential is refered to as the opportunity cost.
If you look at the universe in this manner, and every decision as picking one opportunity over another, you are likely to agree with me when I say that the true wealth we obtain in this short life of ours is the potential we realize, and that the true loss is all the unrealized potential that could have been realized. Thinking in this way is likely to help you realize how important it is to update the economic system such that we avoid the greatest loss and obtain the greatest wealth.
*Is the opportunity cost of sticking with Capitalism, instead of updating to Rewardism, not too high? Do you not realize?*

The Big Forgiveness

“To err is human, to forgive, divine.” — Alexander Pope, An Essay On Criticism

How have you obtained your property? Do you oppose the update because you fear losing your property? Fear not. No matter what you have done to obtain your property, it is a matter of the past. We look on to the future. All I can say is, if I was in your place, I would have done the same. I believe so because it is fairly evident that we live in a deterministic universe. So, solving problems matter more to me than accusing and punishing.
It is not your fault that you did whatever you did. Had there been a better system in place, a system which focused on the causes and did not allow any wrongdoing, you would not have been able to do anything wrong. We are all together in this. We have failed to update the system, and we have not evolved enough to be perfect within an imperfect system. Let us all realize how much this update means to all of us.
*I do not ask you to confess, nor do I ask you to give up your property. I offer you my hand. Do you not seek salvation?*

On Inheritance

Before I help you understand why I oppose inheritance, understand that the lack of inheritance is not an essential feature of Rewardism. All the other features of Rewardism can be implemented while still allowing for inheritance. Now, consider a world without the notion of inheritance. Think of the value of property in such a world. How would people perceive the well-off ones? How would your life be different?
Now consider the world where people inherit the properties of their ancestors. Which world better manages resources? Does it not make sense that property should belong to those who have actually earned it, instead of those who are merely born in the *right family*? When you look at someone in a luxury car, do you think of the person as being a valuable contributor to the society, or are their doubts as to the source of the car?
I realize that the cold turkey method might not be appropriate. An abrupt end to inheritance might be too big a change for it to be feasible. That is why I suggest that we start by allowing people to inherit their immediate parents’ wealth, but disallowing any further inheritance. This change is not as big as completely ending inheritance, so, it is more feasible. In the future, when we have evolved enough, there can be an update that completely ends inheritance.
*Patch End-Inheritance will have to wait for now.*

On Capital Gains

Linked with the authenticity and value of property, and the need for a proper rewarding mechanism is the issue of capital gains. To better understand what the issues at hand are, consider the following fictitious examples:

	*1. John earns his income by doing heart surgery mainly. Sam makes a living exploiting weaknesses in the stock market. While John is saving lives, Sam is buying low and selling high. Arguably, John contributes more to the society than Sam. Yet, Sam earns more than John, simply by benefitting from capital gains. Do you not see what is wrong here?*
	*2. Salman bought a small land and a newly developed house in a developing society in his city an year ago. Now that the society is more developed, the prices there have increased. Without doing any effort, simply by waiting an year, Salman has more than doubled his networth. With the high demand for property in that society, he easily sells the house and locks in his profit. He holds on to the land for further capital appreciation. Do you not see what is wrong here?*
	*3. Eliza, a business owner in India, wants to bribe Raj, a powerful government official there. Rewardism has been deployed in India but capital gains were allowed. Raj buys a simple painting for 5,000 INR RPs. Eliza offers to buy the painting for 50M INR RPs. The transaction occurs, Raj earns about 50M INR RPs, and 50M INR RPs are burned away from Eliza’s account. This is recorded as a genuine transaction in the both, Raj’s, and Eliza’s acount. Do you not see what is wrong here?*
