Chapter 7: Deployment

Is there an optimal way to replace the current economic system with a newer, and possibly, better, economic system? If there is one, how can we know it? Please, take a moment to think about the best possible way we can deploy Rewardism. Who might oppose Rewardism, and more importantly, why? What should we be aware of when trying to replace the older system? Please, save your answers, and contribute to the deployment of Rewardism, when the time is right.

1) Preliminary Stage

“We have changed the world so much, that it’s high time to interpret it.” — Slavoj Žižek

Is it not possible that I am unaware of some flaws in my reasoning? Perhaps, what I consider best for everyone, or what I think leads to advancement, might actually be the reason for our downfall and misery. How can I be aware of my fallacies? The answer is “constructive criticism” — not just being aware of the fallacies of others but also appreciating criticism of my own ideas and arguments.
Before you make an investment, start a career, or take any important decision, what is it that you do so carefully? To decide responsibly, first, you have to process whatever data is available to get some useful information; then, you have to deeply analyze and evaluate that information. You have to consider as many significant possibilities as you can, weigh your options, and think about all the ways it can go wrong.
Does it not make sense to know exactly what the change should be *before* we put in the effort to bring about that change? So, in the Preliminary Stage, the main goal is to optimize Rewardism such that the balance between its risks and rewards becomes optimal, and to communicate the final version of it so that those putting in the effort know exactly what the change will be.
This preliminary stage is of the utmost importance as, if all goes well, most of the problems associated with Rewardism will be dealt with before it goes live, making it easier for it to outperform previous economic systems. If this stage is executed properly, people will trust Rewardism more because they will know that it has been optimized, and, recall from the previous chapter, that too by the most talented individuals.
One significant risk is *misunderstanding*. People might not really understand Rewardism, and so, they might have irrational fears. The documentation of the new system is crucial for properly dealing with this risk, as this means higher transparency, and better communication of the significant details of Rewardism. Without a clear document explaining what exactly is Rewardism, the public will be left in the dark.

1A) Rewardism: The Initial Draft
How shall we prepare the document explaining the general version of Rewardism? The whole process shall be divided in to three stages. The first stage shall last about 2 years. At this stage, only the most talented ten individuals shall accompany me, privately, in preparing the initial draft. The major aspects of the system shall be discussed, and improvements shall be made. The initial draft is to comprehensively explain how the base standard of living will be set, how necessities will be distinguished from luxuries, and other details.
There are some essential features of Rewardism without which the system cannot be called Rewardism; such essential features are to be highlighted in the initial draft, and no compromise shall be made on these essential features. To gain the public’s trust, and therfore, to get better colaboration in the next stages, the initial draft is to include a detailed comparison of Rewardism, Communism and Capitalism. This comparison is to be complimented by significant reasons for adopting Rewardism.

1B) Rewardism: The Mezzanine Draft
The second stage shall last about 3 years. Once we have an initial draft to present to the *key players*, their concerns must be understood. The significance of a key player, and therefore, their concerns, is directly proportional to their ability to affect, both positively and negatively, the deployment of Rewardism. By preparing a new draft that accounts for the concerns of the key players, naturally, the deployment shall be smoother.
There is a possibility that some entities might not trust the new digital currency, or they might think of Rewardism as some sort of scam. To manage the significant risk of mistrust, highly influential people shall be invited to judge the current version of Rewardism, and their reasonable ideas shall be used to improve it. If such influential people find Rewardism appealing, and if they spread the word, it can significantly strengthen the public’s trust in Rewardism.

1C) Rewardism: The Final Document
The final stage shall last about 5 years. With the Mezzanine Draft available to the general public, its concerns’ can be considered. Some platform shall be given to the public, to voice their opinions. This final stage will be the most difficult, as, with so many entities involved, the chances of conflict of interest would be high. The main goal is to finalize the general version of Rewardism, such that the risk of opposition is optimally managed. To achieve this goal, preference given to a suggestion shall be based on how influential or talented the suggester is.

Once the general version of Rewardism is known, each Rewardist country will then have its *final* and specific version of Rewardism, explained in its own document, and approved by its relevant authorities. Here, it should be noted that the *final* document does not mean that there will be no improvements in the future. There shall be *patches* in the future, accompanied by *patch notes*. Once we have a good understanding of what exactly the changes should be, the planning phase should begin.
