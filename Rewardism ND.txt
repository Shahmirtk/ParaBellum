Chapter 7: Deployment

Is there an optimal way to replace the current economic system with a newer, and possibly, better, economic system? If there is one, how can we know it? Please, take a moment to think about the best possible way we can deploy Rewardism. Who might oppose Rewardism, and more importantly, why? What should we be aware of when trying to replace the older system? Please, save your answers, and contribute to the deployment of Rewardism, when the time is right.

1.) Preliminary Stage

“We have changed the world so much, that it’s high time to interpret it.” — Slavoj Žižek

Is it not possible that I am unaware of some flaws in my reasoning? Perhaps, what I consider best for everyone, or what I think leads to advancement, might actually be the reason for our downfall and misery. How can I be aware of my fallacies? The answer is “accepting constructive criticism” — not just being aware of the fallacies of others but also appreciating criticism of my own ideas and arguments, and acknowledging the fact that my arguments can be fallacious too.
/Before you make an investment, start a career, or take any important decision, what is it that you do so carefully? Assuming that you take such decisions responsibly, you first carry out an in-depth analysis of whatever data is available and evaluate it; you consider as many possibilities as you can and you weigh your options; you think about all the ways it can go wrong; in other words, you try to understand every significant thing relating to the task at hand, especially the relevant consequences, and you do this as objectively as you can. So, in the preliminary stage you have to understand everything relating to the system, how to establish it, and the different consequences of establishing it. By now, I hope you have a good understanding about the importance of establishing the reward-based decision and about the weaknesses of the money-based system./
Does it not make sense to know exactly what the change should be *before* we put in the effort to bring about that change? So in the Preliminary Stage, Rewardism should be criticized, so as to strengthen it, by the most talented and concerned ones.
