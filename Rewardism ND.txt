Chapter 7: Deployment

Is there an optimal way to replace the current economic system with a newer, and possibly, better, economic system? If there is one, how can we know it? Please, take a moment to think about the best possible way we can deploy Rewardism. Who might oppose Rewardism, and more importantly, why? What should we be aware of when trying to replace the older system? Please, save your answers, and contribute to the deployment of Rewardism, when the time is right.

1.) Preliminary Stage

“We have changed the world so much, that it’s high time to interpret it.” — Slavoj Žižek

Is it not possible that I am unaware of some flaws in my reasoning? Perhaps, what I consider best for everyone, or what I think leads to advancement, might actually be the reason for our downfall and misery. How can I be aware of my fallacies? The answer is “constructive criticism” — not just being aware of the fallacies of others but also appreciating criticism of my own ideas and arguments.
Before you make an investment, start a career, or take any important decision, what is it that you do so carefully? To decide responsibly, first, you have to process whatever data is available to get some useful information; then, you have to deeply analyze and evaluate that information. You have to consider as many significant possibilities as you can, weigh your options, and think about all the ways it can go wrong.
Does it not make sense to know exactly what the change should be *before* we put in the effort to bring about that change? So, in the Preliminary Stage, the main goal is to optimize Rewardism such that the balance between its risks and rewards becomes optimal, and to communicate the final version of it so that those putting in the effort know exactly what the change will be.
This preliminary stage is of the utmost importance as, if all goes well, most of the problems associated with Rewardism will be dealt with before it goes live, making it easier for it to outperform previous economic systems. If this stage is executed properly, people will trust Rewardism more because they will know that it has been optimized, and, recall from the previous chapter, that too by the most talented individuals.
One significant risk is *misunderstanding*. People might not really understand Rewardism, and so, they might have irrational fears. The documentation of the new system is crucial for properly dealing with this risk, as this means higher transparency, and better communication of the significant details of Rewardism. Without a clear document explaining what exactly is Rewardism, the public will be left in the dark.
/Keep in mind that even though this would be the finalized document, this does not mean that there will be no improvement in the future. The purpose of the finalized document is to act as a guidance for establishing the system for the first time. Once the system starts running normally, it can then be improved further. Once this document is ready, the planning phase should begin./
