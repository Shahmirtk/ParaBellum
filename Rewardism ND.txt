Chapter 7: Deployment

Is there an optimal way to replace the current economic system with a newer, and possibly, better, economic system? If there is one, how can we know it? Please, take a moment to think about the best possible way we can deploy Rewardism. Who might oppose Rewardism, and more importantly, why? What should we be aware of when trying to replace the older system? Please, save your answers, and contribute to the deployment of Rewardism, when the time is right.

1.) Preliminary Stage

“We have changed the world so much, that it’s high time to interpret it.” — Slavoj Žižek

Is it not possible that I am unaware of some flaws in my reasoning? Perhaps, what I consider best for everyone, or what I think leads to advancement, might actually be the reason for our downfall and misery. How can I be aware of my fallacies? The answer is “constructive criticism” — not just being aware of the fallacies of others but also appreciating criticism of my own ideas and arguments.
Before you make an investment, start a career, or take any important decision, what is it that you do so carefully? To decide responsibly, first, you have to process whatever data is available to get some useful information; then, you have to deeply analyze and evaluate that information. You have to consider as many significant possibilities as you can, weigh your options, and think about all the ways it can go wrong.
Does it not make sense to know exactly what the change should be *before* we put in the effort to bring about that change? So, in the Preliminary Stage, the main goal is to optimize Rewardism such that the balance between its risks and rewards becomes optimal, and to communicate the final version of it so that those putting in the effort know exactly what the change will be.
This preliminary stage is of the utmost importance as, if all goes well, most of the problems associated with Rewardism will be dealt with before it goes live, making it easier for it to outperform previous economic systems. If this stage is executed properly, people will trust Rewardism more because they will know that it has been optimized, and, recall from the previous chapter, that too by the most talented individuals.
One significant risk is *misunderstanding*. People might not really understand Rewardism, and so, they might have irrational fears. The documentation of the new system is crucial for properly dealing with this risk, as this means higher transparency, and better communication of the significant details of Rewardism. Without a clear document explaining what exactly is Rewardism, the public will be left in the dark.
So, how should the document be prepared? The whole process shall be divided in to three stages. The first stage shall last about 2 years. At this stage, only the most talented ten individuals shall accompany me, privately, in preparing the initial draft. The major aspects of the system shall be discussed, and improvements shall be made. The initial draft is to comprehensively explain how the base standard of living shall be set, how necessities shall be distinguished from luxuries, and other details.
To gain the public’s trust, and therfore, to get more colaboration in the next stages, the initial draft shall include a detailed comparison of Rewardism, Communism and Capitalism. This comparison shall be accompanied with an objective explanation of how the pros and cons of the previous systems have been accounted for.
/<Document Publishing: Stage 2>  The second stage should last about 4 years. Other professionals should be given access to the approved initial draft version of the document, so that they too can suggest improvements. As many suggestions as possible should be considered and the document should be updated accordingly. By the end of the year, the updated document should be approved by the overseers so that the final stage can start.
!* <Preliminary, Planning> People might not trust this digital currency: People like Elon, Bill, etc., if convinced, can influence people who trust them to trust this digital currency. Seems like a scam, doesn't feel very practical: Discuss with professionals and refine it. They can then give people assurance that this is no scam. Government support can help too./


{Shift to after the final stage of publishing.} The final document prepared in this stage would explain the general version of Rewardism. Each Rewardist country will have its specific version of Rewardism, explained in its own document. Keep in mind that the *final* document does not mean that there will be no improvement in the future. There should be *patches* in the future, accompanied by *patch notes*. Once we have a good understanding of what exactly the changes should be, the planning phase should begin.
