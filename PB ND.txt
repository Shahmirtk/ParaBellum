Unemployed:

Humbled by orphanage, driven by passion and supported by teachers, you embark on the pursuit of knowledge and excellence. Without any affinity for wealth or the luxurious life, RPs and BPs don't matter to you. So, you spend most of your time researching and surviving on whatever you get using your NPs. You find yourself mostly surrounded by educational material, research work, intellectuals and your thoughts. At times you don't even know if it's day or night while researching your favourite topics.

In college, you ace almost every exam. You focus on epistemology, ethics and economics. What really interests you is evolution; the evolution of ideas and conditions. You always try to learn more and more about how so much change came to be over the years, what was the role of ethics and economics in it and what change can we bring now. What really fascinates you is how much the Hegelian dialectic and the Socratic dialectic make sense, both from a holist and reductionist perspective.
